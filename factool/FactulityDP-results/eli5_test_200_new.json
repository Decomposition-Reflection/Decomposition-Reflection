Why would buying a lot of OJ at a high price ruin the Duke Brothers?", "answer": ["The final scene involves future contracts. This simply means entering into a contract to buy something (oil, wheat, even frozen concentrated orange juice(FCOJ)) at a specified time for the current price. The person selling the future does not have to own the FCOJ at the time of sale he simply has to provide them at the agreed upon date. Futures help companies mitigate risk against the unpredictable price of FCOJ. If the price of FCOJ goes up the buyer wins the seller loses and visa versa. This price is often affected by fresh oranges. If there is a good harvest FCOJ price goes down and so on. The Dukes believed there was going to be a bad harvest. Their plan was to buy as much FCOJ as they could and basically corner the market then sell it at a much higher price due to a lack of oranges. So here is what happened. At first Winthrop and Valentine begin selling futures contracts at inflated prices caused by the Dukes (on the info from the fake report of a bad orange harvest) at approximately $1.45 per unit. When the report comes out that the orange harvest is expected to be good caused a massive selloff and the futures price plummeted to about $.22 cents. This is when Winthrop and Valentine begin buying futures instead of selling. So now they can fill the futures orders of $1.45 with oranges costing $.22 earning something like a 545% profit.", "They had an episode of Marketplace that addressed this a few weeks ago:  URL_0 ", "NPR actually did a interview explaining everything pretty well.

In a nutshell, they were buying contracts that afford them the legal right to purchase units of OJ at a specific price. Since they knew the price of OJ would fall (remember the dude with the locked briefcase?) they were buying option contracts to purchase OJ at a higher price. Anyone with half a brain would sell them these and of course that's what happened. For in depth knowledge, look up \"how futures trading works.\"", "The unrealistic part of that flick is not the trading but Winthorp and Valentine being able just to waltz in to that pit and stand wherever they want.

However, what you see that lasts in the sky as a contrail is water vapor byproducts of the fuel combustion.", "Jets passing over typically are flying at altitudes where temperatures are fairly low - -40C. At this temperature, in clear air, there isn't a lot of water vapor (humidity) in the air. A jet engine takes this air in and uses it to burn fuel, which it pushes out of its exhaust. The fuel burns to mostly carbon dioxide and water. The air exiting the engine now has considerable water vapor in it. The exiting air mixes with the surrounding air, dropping its temperature rapidly. When hot, this air could hold a lot of water vapor. After cooling, it can't. The water vapor, which is clear, has to go somewhere, and where it goes is into ice or water droplets. These are no longer invisible, but reflect light, and appear white. There's a little more than that, in that the jet engine doesn't really burn the fuel perfectly, so some stuff is left over other than carbon dioxide and water - partly burned fuel. This makes particles that are needed to start the water vapor on its way to becoming liquid water or ice. These particles are called seeds.", "Jets leave white trails, or contrails, in their wakes for the same reason you can sometimes see your breath.

As I'm sure you learned in class, pressure and temperature are related. Wings work because they create a low pressure area on top and a high pressure area on bottom -- the wing is essentially sucked upwards. Since the air pressure around the wing is changing so drastically (and complicated things happen to the air after the wing has traveled through it) you can have a reasonably large change in temperature of the air that is at low pressure. If the temperature of air changes, it also changes the amount of water vapor that can possibly be mixed in the air -- so if the temperature drops enough, some of the water vapor can condense out into either liquid water droplets or ice crystals.", "Fuel and Oxygen mix and burn in the engines and produce water and carbon dioxide.

Colonizing forces sharpened and deepened this divide as a way to ease their control over the society, making it more explicitly ethnic. By the time colonization ended, the group identities had solidified as a basis for the political and social order. The divide continued to be used in politics and ultimately spiraled into the genocide.", "This is what I know of the topic from my time in Rwanda: Initially Hutu and Tutsi had recognizable differences (mainly the shape of their noses) and just focused on different things. With the arrival of the Belgians and their interests in controlling the people, they introduced a national ID paper where it would also state whether someone was a Hutu, a Tutsi or else (there were/are other tribes as well). Afterwards it was also possible to acquire the status of Tutsi depending on your wealth (how many cows you owned). Then Tutsi started being given more and more positions of power, which then became some sort of requirement. This led to a growing distance between the two groups causing the rapture we know about. Basically tagging people and discriminating some (the majority) led to the genocide, especially because of the non-intervention of outsiders.", "So before the Europeans arrived Rwandan and Burundian society had a hierarchy with Tutsis at the top and Hutus and the twa at the bottom there was no clear racial distinction because most Rwandans have the same features and the system was primarily economic with the those who were rich considered Tutsis and those without considered Hutus. Then the Belgians came and colonized the region and they saw the hierarchical system as a way to effectively control the people. In doing so they added a racial dynamic in which those with lighter skin,narrow noses and tall height were considered Tutsi while those who had more negroid features were considered Hutu or twa. The Tutsis who ran Rwanda weren't very nice to the Hutus and this sowed the hatred and resentment for the Tutsis amongst Hutus. This changed with the wave of African independence movements which made the Tutsis demand independence(because being upper class they were more educated and were more exposed to pan Africanist ideas spreading at the time).This resulted in Belgium switching its support to the Hutus because with Tutsi leaders pushing for independence there was a fear that Rwanda would become communist and Hutus were seen as easier to control. Eventually the Hutus would overthrow the Tutsi monarchy in Rwanda which was then followed by a purge of Tutsi leading many into exile and installing a hardline regime that ruled until it was overthrown in 1994, by The Rwandan patriotic front led by Tutsi exiles based and supported by Uganda.", "Not an expert, but my understanding is that the colonial powers installed the Tutsis in a position of power.

Besides that, being naturally coordinated would help controlling the muscles which keep a steady pitch or vibrato or volume, being naturally gifted in pitch and tone differentiation would be important(good ear, perfect pitch), and because IMO natural abilities get a little too much credit with the general public, a natural patience, memory, intelligence, passion and persistence would all be very important when it comes to learning and practicing.

So they tie Google up in legal paperwork and local monopolies get it blocked. I really wish Google would've hired me for the Atlanta fiber team. I would've been keeping everyone updated to what's taking so long. I'm pretty sure I could beast through all this political garbage. The fastest way through red tape is to steamroll through it. :)", "One of two possibilities, firstly Google doesn't really want to be an ISP but wants to coax other ISP's into rolling out substantial faster internet services. Secondly Google can't roll out fiber everywhere it wants by throwing money at it. Who gets Google fiber and when might not be in Googles control.", "Putting stuff in the ground takes time. On top of that there's a lot of paperwork, city regulations and so on. That's part of the reason why Google Fibre isn't going to be everywhere, Google are only picking cities which are \"easy\" for it to roll out in.", "Bureaucracy, Politics, and money are the reason. Google has the money, but most local governments have some sort of contracts with 1 or more ISPs that essentially grant them a monopoly(or a near monopoly) over certain areas. This is the reason why a lot of ISPs have failed and companies like Comcast refuse to increase bandwidth because they know they have a monopoly and they have enough money to get the local city officials on their side and shut down competitors.", "There are a few factors: * Installing the fibre is expensive, so google will only roll it out where there is enough market to support it (or where there will be enough market during the lifetime). Add to this that as soon as Google moves to put in fibre, the existing providers all drop their prices and try to lock in customers contractually to prevent google from succeeding. * Planning can be hard to get. Some local governments already granted monopolies to other providers, others don't want the hassle, still others are getting kickbacks from existing suppliers to \"stand on the hose\". * The idea for google is not to actually roll out it's fibre nationwide. That's not the business they want to be in. The idea is to force existing providers to up their game and do their actual jobs nationwide. It's sort of like how google are not in the bus business and don't want to be. But they run their own buses because otherwise there is no way for the workers to get to work on time. Google does not want to be your ISP or an infrastructure company. But since your ISP and Infra companies are so bad, it's having to do their job for them just to get their product to you."]}
{"example_id": 11, "context": "", "question": "as someone from the UK, I have no idea why obamacare has been getting so much hate. explain.", "answer": ["Obamacare mandates that you buy healthcare insurance, or apply for free coverage from the government if you're poor enough or old enough to qualify. It gives subsidies based on income. Long story short, there are a lot of Americans who think that the free market is the best solution to all problems - healthcare included. They view Obamacare as evil for two reasons: 1) it forces you to purchase something against your will, and 2) it runs contrary to free market principles. Many (most?) of these people also tend believe that healthcare in the US is significantly superior to that which exists in the UK/Canada/Switzerland/etc.. Thus, any move toward a European model is viewed as a degradation of current services.", "If you understand what \"obamacare\" is, you might understand the opposition. It's NOT government medical service (like NHS). It's NOT government medical insurance (like Canada). It's NOT free market medicine. IT IS mandatory purchase of private insurance (racket). In essence it's the worst of all worlds. Not to mention, it was imposed upon the US in abnormal circumstances, without actual debate or public scrutiny. It mandates millions of new customers to wealthy medical insurance companies, and results in significantly higher premiums. It does not address the rising prices of medical services, it makes it the law you must pay for them, and if you don't you must pay more tax. (though currently the law does not include prison for failure to pay those new taxes, you can bet in short order that it will include \"criminal\" sentences in the near future.) So, it boils down to this, people who like \"Obamacare\" don't know what it actually is (or they might be evil). People who oppose it, can do math.", "In general people don't like it for several reasons: 1. Congress passed the law and President Obama signed it without allowing the public to read the law. This isn't necessarily unprecedented but it riles folks up anyway. 2. Congress passed the law using the reconciliation process. Normally an important bill needs at least 60 votes in the senate to pass, but the senate used a special process to pass the bill with 51 votes instead. It was a very shady, underhanded way to get the law passed. (This is very ELI5 - there's a lot more to it) 3. Many Americans are inherently distrustful of government, especially the federal government. It's something that's ingrained in our culture. Many of us don't even trust the government to handle basic government services due to personal experiences, so trusting them with anything to do with something so intimate (healthcare) is not easy for Americans. 4. For many people, especially small business owners who make a decent income, their existing plans were cancelled due to the new regulations, and the new healthcare plans that match the new regulations are often more costly. I'm at work and out of time for the moment, but there are so many more reasons. It's not 100% bad, but it's not the right solution.", "Its really really expensive. I don't qualify for any tax credits and for my family of four it's two fucking thousand dollars a month. TWO FUCKING THOUSAND DOLLARS!", "I'm from New Zealand, so I'm just looking at it as an outside observer, but I can completely understand why the idea of a universal healthcare system mightn't be incredibly attractive to an American. You're from the UK, right; how would you feel if the NHS was abolished, and suddenly your healthcare was the responsibility of the European Commission? I'm not saying a publicly-funded healthcare system isn't a good idea. I actually think quite the opposite. But I don't see what's stopping individual states from implementing their own system that best suits their own set of circumstances. I also think it would be a lot easier to sell that solution, specifically tailored to the people of one state, instead to trying to satisfy the whole country with a one-size-fits-all progamme. Would an American be able to explain why none of the states have done this? (I understand Massachusetts had some kind of reform, but it was more along the lines of 'mandated healthcare insurance', à la Obamacare.)", "As someone who opposes Obamacare (but doesn't hate it, just dislikes it very strongly) I'll try explaining. Insurance is all about spreading risk. Some people will end up getting more money than the insurance costs, and some people will pay in more money than they get out. This is how it works for all insurance. Healthcare insurance is difficult to do because of this. Generally speaking, young people will pay in more money than they get out, and old people less, simply from the fact that old people get sicker than young people. All insurance plans account for this fact, which is why large age diverse groups generally have lower costs (and why large employers can often provide healthcare where small ones can't - obviously not true in all cases). In a market where people are forced to buy in, what you get is essentially a tax on young people. Since they are not getting as much out of their insurance as they put in, they'd be better of not having it and saving the money instead, or doing what they please with it. This is why Obama has been so focused on signing up young people - because, for lack of a better phrase, they're the ones it screws over. Now Americans are generally opposed to the government making decisions for you, regardless of whether they are beneficial for yourself or not. And now the government is forcing people to make a decision that is very clearly detrimental to themselves - simply because it is good for a government program as a whole. In essence the healthcare law falls on young people disproportionately, and for very obvious reasons - young people don't vote as often as old people do. In a country where everyone is supposed to be equal in the eyes of the law, the healthcare act is specifically attempting to force through legal means to get young people to make decisions against their interest. I hope this explains this a bit better in a clearly argued way. I know it isn't popular, but besides the crazy pundits who just rage against Obamacare, there are good arguments against it. I'm much less opposed to national insurance programs - which are funded by taxation, which falls on people much more evenly (or at least falls on those that can most afford it, rather than young people who can't). Thanks for reading", "1) Lobbyists from the insurance industry wrote the law, and the law says that you must purchase a product from said insurance industry. Many people find this objectionable. 2) The law was passed with no bipartisan support; the Democrats said \"we win, you lose, deal with it\" to 50% of America. This is polarizing, and generally a bad way to get things done. 3) President Obama lied about it in order to pass it, then again to win a second term in office. He said he would not raise taxes on middle class families (the \"Individual Mandate\" [see point 1] was determined to be a tax by the US Surpreme Court), and he also said that if you like your insurance plan, you can keep your insurance plan (a statement that he knew was false, yet repeated several times). Add on top of all of this: the fact that the implementation of the program was extremely \"sloppy\", and that President Obama is delaying / modifying / not implementing parts of the law on a whim (seemingly for political gain), instead of going to Congress (as the Constitution requires him to do) makes many people wary of the program. **In summary, people are being forced to buy something, despite wide public opposition, and they're not only NOT receiving the service that was promised, it's being delivered in an embarassing and legally dubious way.**", "Because it didn't improve the current situation. It made healthcare more expensive for those who have to purchase it themselves. Because they were stuck on the private industry profit-driven model, and no controls or limits were placed on prices, the insurance companies decided that since everyone _has_ to purchase from them anyhow, there's no reason to lower the price. It's a horrifyingly murdered version of the free market, where demand is locked in at 100%, so the providers are free to charge any price, and make as much profit as they want.

I don't see the point of the insurance because we're paying about $300 per month. **TL;DR** Obamacare is like paying for a nonexistant expensive german car.", "Because Obamacare is just a massive blowjob for the insurance industry. They should something like medicare for all. Not the crap they pushed. It does nothing to bring down costs as they said it would.", "We had health insurance through work. We aren't rich, but above average income earners (so pretty solidly middle class). Our monthly rate for insurance was good and affordable, and our deductibles were reasonable. For the kid I'm about to have, we would have paid about $200 total (for hospital visit) and everything else was covered 100%. Since our plan changed Jan 1st to go along with the new obamacare plan, that $200 will now be a minimum of $2300 just for me - $300 deductible and $2000 max out of pocket for me as an individual since my services are now only covered at 80%. I'm certain I will reach this maximum amount for myself since insurance has become more \"affordable\" but they seemed to have forgotten to make the cost of healthcare affordable and just the hospital visit will run 40k or more (I've already paid out about $1000 out of pocket and I haven't even had the baby yet). If the baby needs care that's another potential $2300 and then I will hit my max cap for the year of $600 deductible for family and $4000 out of pocket for whole family before everything (should) be covered at 100%. So, from $200 to a potential of $4600 just for this one medical event. This will repeat every year depending on what medical issues we have, some years we may not pay much but it will almost certainly be a lot more than we ever had to pay before. Plus our monthly rate has increased. Now, if we had to buy on the exchange in my state? Would be absolutely unaffordable for our family without some serious lifestyle changes. We make too much to qualify for much in subsidies but not enough to actually afford it. Other states have better exchanges but ours basically has one single company that is on it (but others you can buy from individually outside the exchange). If they had actually made the cost of health services affordable it might not be so bad, and our plan is not terrible in comparison to others who now pay $500 a month and end up with 10k deductibles. Being from the UK, your healthcare isn't something you know you pay for monthly, you are used to it being part of your taxes. I know my taxes pay for roads but I don't think each month \"ok, I've paid $25 towards roads this month\". This is a big addition to monthly expenses for most people instead of an assumed expense that's already rolled in and adjusted for in lifestyle. It's a huge change and hit on many peoples income - the very people who didn't have a lot of extra income in the first place. You may be less likely to go into millions of debt for medical care but the people that happens to are a small minority compared to EVERYONE now having their monthly income reduced. Ok, not everyone, but I'd hazard a vast majority are feeling a decent to large hit because of the new plans.", "There are a litany of issues at play. In the interest of ELI5, let me try to break them down clearly: 1. Some people believe that the Affordable Care Act (so-called Obamacare) is an attempt to move us towards a socialized system. Those people often equate socialism with evil and are mad. 2. Some people believe that the USA can not afford the ACA so they are mad. 3. Some people believe the American system has played out very well and that we have the best doctors and services in the world. They view they ACA as a measure that will send good doctors packing, so they are mad. 4. Some people were happy not having health insurance and didn't want to be forced to buy it, so they are mad. 5. Some people just hate anything Obama says, ACA included, so they are mad. 6. Some people wanted to propose it first and Obama beat them to the punch. They can no longer claim this as their victory, so they are mad. Edit: Also, its important to understand the political landscape right now. Fighting between the Democrats and Republicans (the 2 major parties in our system) has become very bitter. Anything one side is for, the other side is staunchly against. This creates a situation where one party is feeding the media one opinion staunchly pro-ACA, and the other is feeding it just the opposite.", "Because it is NOT what it was pitched to be. The ACA was supposedly going to be universal, affordable healthcare - it is not. It is nothing like the NHS. You are still buying insurance at high rates from private insurance companies. You still have all the same private insurance bullsht- deductibles, copays, etc. It does very little to bring down the absolutely staggering cost of US healthcare (over 2x as high as the next highest per capita healthcare cost country, France). It may have started our as a good idea, but it was gutted by insurance companies and special interest groups (lobbyists). The plan ultimately was not written for the people- it was constructed by the private insurance companies. There is no single payer (the most critical part for affordable coverage) entity and so, it is basically shit - a way for insurance companies to get more $$ - a single payer was really the only thing that mattered, but it got removed after Kstreet got their money-grubbing paws on it.", "\"you will be able to keep your plan.....Period\" -- President Obama", "When Obamacare was being introduced, President Obama repeatedly promised that for those who already had healthcare that worked for them, nothing would change. \"If you like your doctor/ insurance plan, you can keep it.\" But when it got rolling, that turned out to be not true at all.

Capitalism and socialism. Either every man for himself, or we all pool our resources and divide them evenly. The problem is, Obamacare is **neither**. It's a product of insurance companies and their lobbies getting together and putting together legislation the *requires* everyone to *buy* health insurance. It was a very clever and well orchestrated cash grab by American insurers to sell more insurance.", "Enough about ACA, let's talk about this scam they call \"Insurance\". I would rather get some medicaid and have my taxes raised than give my money to those Insurance Cartels!!", "It has very little to do with healthcare and is about a government power grab.", "Free healthcare does not equal universal healthcare. The biggest issue I see is that many private insurance premiums cost much, much less than Obamacare, especially for younger, healthy Americans. ANY insurane is principled upon some people paying more while others pay less. We all share a fixed premium, but some will use insurance benefits more than others. Where this screws Obamacare is that the young, healthy Americans (who offset the cost for the older, sicker ones) can typically just go buy a better plan for pennies on the dollar. That leaves the older, sicker group left with higher rates and still stuck on a basic Obama plan. Picture you're getting a group discount for buying hotels. You also get a free upgrade with the group. But then a significant chunk of your party just buys through Expedia or Priceline and gets a smoking deal. Because of your scenario, you can't buy online so you're stuck with (a) not getting the group rate and (b) not getting the upgraded room. That's the biggest flaw with Obamacare. The healthy don't want it and the sick are left with nothing but higher rates and worse care. Ask yourself this- if Obamacare was really THAT amazing, why aren't all the leaches in Washington signing up? Like it or not, America IS a free market economy. If you hate your healthcare, find a better job. Sounds harsh, but that's exactly what many of us have done. Stop being a victim and waiting for the government to bail you out. Low-cost healthcare will always exist for the handicapped or unable, but a large number of the Obamacare critics and fans are neither. Basic healthcare should be a right.

My husband and I work for the same organization, our health insurance is 100% paid for by our employers, but our dependants health insurance is not.

We have been insuring them privately at a rate of about $80 per child. This insurance has always worked well for us, even when my son broke his arm we only paid $100 out of pocket. Now our insurance has been cancelled and we are being offered new policies of $185 a month. Now for my children of 7 and 8 we are required to have insurance that covers everything anyone would ever need, such as colonscopies, mammograms and birth control. (Yes for childen).

Now that even the poor have to pay, many Americans are angry about this health bill.", "I'm very late to the party, but I work in a think tank at an insurance company and this topic has been widely debated. The problem people are having is that it's not really going to act like insurance. Insurance is protection against a future loss. By having a large group pay a monthly premium you offset the cost of a few individuals having huge losses. Each monthly premium is adjusted by your individual risk towards having a loss. Under Affordable Healthcare act you're not paying money into a system to offset future risk, you're paying money so that people without insurance can get assistance. This boils down to essentially you are paying for someone elses surgery who in many cases didn't pay their fair share into insurance to begin with. Another problem for younger demographics is that for 99.99% of people under 40 you're just losing money. Many people in their 20's don't get insurance just because it's far cheaper to just pay for their minor accidents when they occur. Insurance companies know the risk of a 20 year old needing major surgery is slim, so they adjust the insurance rate as such. Under Affordable healthcare act young people are forced to not only have insurance, but to also pay higher monthly premiums than they would normally have. When you add college debt, car payments, cellphone, apartment, saving for a house and saving for retirement into the mix many young adults can't afford the extra money without vastly decreasing their comfort levels.", "In a nutshell? Right Wing nutters hate it because the is forcing people to buy health insurance (subsidized for poor people) instead of letting \"the free market\" decide that poor people should just die of preventable illness.

Deductible has gone up to $700 (which is still not bad, but a 10X difference from the year prior)", "B/c I feel allowing the federal government to force me to buy anything in this manner is a really dangerous precedent.", "First you have to look at what it claims to do, then what problems we have, and then if what it does addresses the problems we have. *What it claims to do*: Make healthcare more accessible and more affordable. For the Accessible part, there were only about 12 million people that are \"Chronically\" uninsured in America. The total \"number of uninsured\" was inflated grossly. And the \"Affordable\" part doesn't hold muster period. There was a lot of hand-waving, saying that uninsured people were costing a ton for Emergency Rooms, and if you got them regular care it would actually be cheaper. In reality what they're really doing is trying to socialize and subsidize insurance payments. If you extend free or subsidized coverage to an extra 30 million people, it's going to cost more, period. Which isn't automatically bad. It's just they weren't honest about it. *What we had* pre-Obamacare The main (valid) complaint is that it is too expensive. And it *was* pretty expensive. The flip side of that expense is that we have very short waiting periods, and our doctor and care networks were very extensive. If my liver started blowing up, I'd get shipped over to Seattle *that night*, and get treated at University of Washington's premiere Medical facility with top doctors. I'd get as good of care as any CEO or any President. This is in contrast to the single-payer systems in Britain and formerly in Canada, where lower costs also mean less supply, so time-sensitive procedures were delayed by days, months, or even years. I say 'former' in Canada because their system was declared a human rights violation about a decade ago, the waits were so bad. So they had to allow private clinics to re-open. Which means, even in 'socialized medicine' you get two classes of treatment. Those for the poor and those for the rich. In America, the disparity of care between classes (amongst the insured) is significantly smaller. But anyway, what was the main cause of the high cost of our system? **This is an important part**. It isn't free-loading ER walk-ins that are making my hospital visits so expensive. It's the incentives of the system that make it so *nobody* has any reason to be efficient. We have a 3-party payment system. Person A pays Insurance Company B to Pay for doctor  &  hospital C for whatever treatments A wants to get. As an example, you go into the doctor with a broken ankle. Before this mess, the doctor would say *\"Yep, that's a sprained ankle. I'll wrap it; take some Advil as you need and stay off it for two weeks\"*. You pay him $40 for his time and you both go on your way. Now, the doctor says: *\"That's a sprained ankle. But I want to get a* [$1000] *MRI to be sure.\"* Because he doesn't want to get sued if you actually have a broken bone. This is called defensive medicine. You say: *\"How much would that cost me?\"* and he says that your insurance covers it, so you say *\"Okay!*\". A $50 visit just became a $1500 visit unnecessarily because the doctor doesn't want to get sued, and you have no reason to say no to an extra and costly test, because it doesn't affect your bottom line. The 3 party payment system insulates choices from consequence. None of us and individually incentivize to care about our health cost. Then we all complain when we all (rationally) act wasteful, because we're paying for all this extra care whether we use it or not. So the question is what does the Affordable Care Act Do? It solidifies the 3-party system. Mandating people buy insurance, and mandating a minimum amount of coverage an insurance plan covers. This includes 50-year-old bachelors paying for pregnancy and mammograms, incidentally. Next, to 'reduce' health costs on the old, they mandate that two people can't pay more than ~3x difference for the same coverage. Now a lung transplant costs the same for me as it does for an 80-year-old smoker. But he's 10x as *likely* to need it. So normally the little part of his payment that goes towards lung transplant coverage should be 10x mine. But it can only be 3x. So my costs are artificially inflated and his deflated until our prices get within those bounds. *This* is socializing medicine - when you have to pay for the average health of the group, rather than pay for the average health of a bunch of clones of you. But wait, this will make healthcare *very* expensive for healthy young kids making very little money just starting out. Especially the ones who were skipping on health insurance to start with. To cover this issue, we add in 'subsidies'. Which adds up to a lot of distorted prices, further insulation of cost, and less choice. So the reason I personally dislike it, is because it had to have this hybrid system to get passed period. And this hybrid system further institutionalizes the very problems that make out healthcare prohibitively expensive. **TL:DR** 3-party system tells everybody to be wasteful with their healthcare service, thinking they're spending other people's money even though it loops back around to them. ACA institutionalizes that, socializes costs by diverting your insurance payment from your predicted healthcare costs, and adds a ton of new subsidized healthcare users to the Federal Dole while throwing a great big bureaucracy on top of a sixth of the economy. There is no world where all of this results in a net gain for the population at large. And as millions of people are getting coverage they liked canceled, they're getting new coverage which is less good, in a smaller network, for a higher cost. And those are among the ~10 million independently insured people. When people who get insurance through their business - when those insurance plans have to comply, you'll see the same thing happen to those ~50 million plans. Tens of millions of people will suffer the same fate. Which is why our President is delaying the mandate unilaterally (without consent of congress despite no provision for such a delay) until after the 2014 election. The 2014 election will be disastrous for Democrats because every single Democrat Senator voted for it, and only democrats voted for it. They can't run away from the disaster, and their majority in the Senate is threatened, so they have to delay the disaster. This is a small taste of the practical and political complaints about the ACA. The TLDR of the TLDR is that it's too complicated, and doesn't actually solve any problems. It just makes us pay our health insurance by funneling money through the government first. 3-party free system into a 4-party coerced system. It will implode when the Business mandate is finally implemented and the majority of Americans actually finally get to experience Obamacare.", "Why I don't like it.

So I still payed $340.50.) Now. I work in fast food because at this particular university, we are surrounded by a rural bible belt county. I say county because the county (not including the population of the uni) has a population of about 10,000. The individual towns hover around 2,000, meaning there is not a lot of businesses around here, and I say bible belt because I have to point out that almost everything around here closes at 5pm Mon-Fri, 2pm on Saturdays and almost everything is closed on Sundays. So finding a job that I can work after my morning classes end around noon ish is fast food. I struggle, and I sweat and I stress out every day for the legal minimum of $7.25 an hour. This means, if I am able to work 35 hours a week, I'll get paid 507 bucks every two weeks. Minus state/federal taxes, which works out to around 17% when added together. So of 507, Ill make 421.50. Minus the healthcare at 15%. So now I'm at $345. Working from 3pm to 11Pm daily, I have to work 5 days a week almost to make that. Under Obamacare, businesses like mine will have to pay the cost of my healthcare for me. (The 15% of my income that I pay now.) Except the business will have to pay more than I've been paying, because they are required to cover me . If I work at least 29 hours a week. I repeat IN ORDER TO BE COVERED, I HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN 29 HOURS A WEEK. If I don't work that 29 hours, my business becomes exempt from paying for my healthcare. So what do they do? They cut my hours back to less than 29 hours and I go back to where I was before, except now I can only work 28 hours a week. So now I start at 403 dollars. Minus healthcare is 345, minus regular taxes I'm now left with $275. Times 2 for the month means I make 550 a month with Obamacare. ( my health care is slightly better and cheaper, but I'm in great health so it doesnt affect me anyways.) I have pretty cheap rent- utilities plus rent itself comes out to a pretty consistent $465 a month. Now I have $85 dollars left for the month to pay my cell and my gas and my insurance and my groceries. Obviously that isn't enough. I go into debt. Before obamacare I had $690 a month minus rent/utilities and leftover was 225. I was poor as shit, but I could make it stretch into what I had to pay. This is just one example. Ask other Americans how it affects them. For me, it puts me into debt. If this gets replies/karma I will come back and give you more examples of other ways it affects me.", "There are two reasons why: (1) Some people don't want nationalized health care. The belief can stem from fear of government intrusion into their lives (anytime the governments money gets in something, you play by their rules, etc), slower service, getting denied for care, etc. Then there are the people that want free market only options. (2) But the bigger reason is the terrible implementation of it, what it doesn't do, and its increase in costs (either by premium spikes or by lower coverage than you got before. Obamacare is not free health care. You still have to pay for the insurance. You might be eligible for subsidies or you might not. Even if you are, HOLY FREAKING COW the deductibles are crazy! Common low tier plans have an average of $5000 annual deductible per person (about $12,000 for a family) before coverage even begins (at only 60% coverage). We spent over $600 million a website that is terrible and has been plagued by problems. Many people have seen their premiums spike or their deductibles increase dramatically (personally, my prices have dropped about 5% but my deductibles have increased over 60%). Worst of all, it doesn't really do much of anything to stem the costs of medical care. We don't have review boards that determine procedure costs. We still have the \"throw it at the wall and see what sticks\" system that has been shafting us. So you might have health insurance now when you didn't before, but if you were too poor to have it before and now you do have a major accident, you are still out several thousand dollars before coverage even begins. Yes, you may not be out $100k, but you still might be financially destroyed.", "Because America has a great sickness. Americans have decided that anything the government gives away will be abused to the point of bankrupting the country. They believe that although they themselves are trustworthy and have no problem taking advantage of whatever programs they can that nobody else should because they would abuse it. They believe that although the richest 35 people have more money then the poorest 35 million that its because they worked harder some how and earned it by being super smart. They believe that the poor are poor because they are stupid and refuse to work hard, and even though they themselves work hard and are underpaid that any minute they could be turned into billionaires and if they were billionaires they wouldn't want the government taxing them so they support the nontaxing of the rich. Then you have the whole \"job creators\" joke where the rich are job creators so you shouldn't mess with them when its total BS. the rich squirrel away their money demanding high interest on it, the middle/lower class spend all their money on stuff so that money goes back into the economy. so the poor and middle class are the job creators because they create demand, the rich suck out the money they spend and squirrel it away. I watched a great documentary last night about the gap between rich and poor and its amazing people don't see it. how the rich spend very little of their money while the middle/low spend all of theirs. if the rich were forced to spend all their income yearly like the other classes then the economy would be amazing.", "So, most of the responses on here are really great as far as explaining what health care is like in the US, as well as in other countries, but to actually answer OP's question. It has been getting so much hate because the opposition party has done, and will continue to do everything it can to make the Obama administration appear to be ineffective while also trying to make it appear as though the administration is over reaching it's power. The top Republican(opposition party) in the senate even stated during the presidents first term that their priority should be to make sure that Obama was a one term president. The truly interesting kicker in all of this is that in the 90's the Republicans proposed a very similar plan. Furthermore, a Republican governor signed a similar plan into law in the state of Massachusetts. That governor went on to challenge Barack Obama for the presidency in 2012 you may remember Mitt Romney. TL:DR It has much less to do with the policy itself and much more to do with the the politics of the opposing parties.", "It's a complicated issue for sure.. Bottom line? It's an attempt to have more people covered WITHOUT addressing the root cause of the issue. Healthcare in the United States is too expensive! Yes mandating coverage by the government is Un-American. It takes the choice away from the individual which is, largely, a no-go for many people. Couple that with it now being MORE expensive for middle income Americans (premiums, deductibles etc), the lies about \"keeping your doctor\", and it's effect on employment mandates for small companies or larger ones.

Now cue 20 yrs and you have hospitals, clinics and big pharma gouging people for basics. The thought was that insurance would be subsidized by the healthier to pay for the unhealthy and uninsured but because everybody has their hand in your pocket the insurance companies were becoming unprofitable... Something had to change.... Hillary get back here! America is also in deep debt so any scheme to extort money from the already underwater population looked good too. Intro Obamacare. A nefarious scheme to force America to buy insurance, and those who don't pay a tax; all done under the color of law.... Trouble by decree. It's premise was medieval. By forcing people to purchase insurance the insurance companies stand to profit in ways unheard of. For those who choose not to participate they benefit the government by being taxed. Win-Win for Uncle Sam and insurance companies. What about the people? In order to pull the wool over the American public's eyes, untruth had to prevail and prevail it did. *\"If you like your current plan/Dr you can keep it\", Barrack Obama*... **AN EPIC LIE BY AN EPIC LIAR!!!** Plans got canceled and people lost their doctors. By forcing everybody into a policy insurance, companies could triple or even quadruple the price of a premium. Or you could just sign up for Obamacare or one of your states exchange programs -that also don't work cause everybody who was contracted to set up the websites took the money and ran....to the the tune of billions of tax payer dollars. So basically we are now forced to purchase healthcare that's 3-4X what we used to pay or get taxed; AND we must also spend an absolutely unjust amount out of pocket after premiums to cover the deductible before coverage even begins... The alternative to the dupe is the tax, which is something like $600 or 1% of our income or whichever is higher- (could be wrong on this though). There's much more but already angry just typing this. I'm sure others will fill in missing details. Again this is not nor ever was about caring for the health of the people...this was about making money for insurance companies, big pharma and the U.S gob't.....be all end all! **So what is the ONLY solution???** Daniel 2:44, Matt 6:9-10.... “Amen! Come, Lord Jesus.” Revelation 22:20", "Honestly, there are many reasons why people don't like this, so the answer would likely confuse a five year old. America has never been big on socialized things, so on its face making everybody pay in to get insurance just rubs people the wrong way. There is also a deep distrust of the federal government which can be traced to the deep mistrust of the British government all those years ago. Beyond that, there are different groups with different views. There are some who want a system like the NHS in the UK where this does not go far enough. To these people, as to others, the subsidies to corporations like insurance companies and hospitals are abhorrent. To others, this is a violation of the free market and a dramatic increase in what is already a very large government. Like I said before, people do not trust the feds, and beyond that they don't trust them to do something well. So all people can see is tax increases and inefficiency. Lastly, no one, and I mean no one likes medical insurance. It is expensive. It is capricious. It is maddening. It hides prices so no one knows how much anything costs. So how is it better to enshrine into the entitlements of the country something which people despise? Anyone who has received a denial of service from the insurance company after having seen a doctor and getting a doctor's bill for the full amount knows what I am talking about. Lastly, it is expensive. Here, traditionally, insurance is partially paid by the employer, and what people see when they see the prices on the exchanges is the non-subsidized price, which can be over double what people normally pay, so the whole concept of affordable becomes a value judgement, where sure if you don't have any income it's free, but if you are earning a low income at some point it becomes very, very expensive. So that's why people hate it.", "Obama Care does exactly zero to control costs for the average person. It offers no transparency in the prices charges nor any consistency. It imposed a law to pay or be penalized on individuals and businesses. Pretty much a huge tax increase. Hospitals and medical providers are not required to tell you what a service costs before a procedure. Let's say you have a routine colonoscopy scheduled. The prices are negotiated by third parties. The provider comes up with a ridiculous price they bill and the insurance - whether it's Medicare or Private - has already decided what their agreement to pay the facility will be. The price the provider bills has no basis in reality, it's just highly inflated so the provider can get paid all they can after the insurance has discounted it. The cash pay customer gets screwed because they don't have access to the same discounted rates - sometimes as high as 80%! Then the other problem! You go for that routine procedure. You have a set date under your insurance as a copay and everything is included. At the last minute the routine anesthesia provider is not available for a multitude of legitimate reasons. So the MD uses another provider. That one may not have the same agreement with the insurance so the insurance company says whoa, we aren't paying and you get sent the bill. In its application Obama Care - the Affordable Care Act - is only affordable to the great big conglomerates and that's why you see huge mergers in Healthcare now. The big organizations are going to win. The system won't provide any better for the vast majority of people, it will only ensure that the average working person will pay out the nose without any control of benefits. Edited some autocorrect. :)", "Coming from an American who does not and never has supported the new healthcare laws we have a lot of reasons why we are against it. First the law was abnormally passed in the house of reps using a basically a procedural trick, without the support of a single republican, and with a majority of American against it. So as far as it being unpopular it never has been anything but. If the law was even a half decent piece of legislation it would not have already been changed 38 times, that is unprecedented. If a law is so poorly written that it has to been changed numerous times right after being passed, how bad will it be in the long term? Cost....... this is the the biggest for most people. The president and everyone involved in this has lied numerous times about how this would reduce cost for everyone. Nothing has been further from the truth. Everyones insurance premiums have gone up tremendously, and often to receive less coverage than they used to have. Note on other countries having better healthcare, the notion that Canadian or European healthcare is better is laughable. The study most people site that statistic from is flawed. It does not adjust for our violent crime rate which is much higher than Canada's and most of Europes. If you adjust for all the murders and victims would fare no better elsewhere the US is number one in healthcare. Canada does not even have the Gama Knife yet, canadians have to come here for treatment for many types of brain cancer because they would die in Canada.", "Here is why I dont like it. I I've been privately insured for my entire adult life through my employer's insurance. I work for a small company but the coverage was still very good and affordable for both myself and my employer. The insurance company that offered coverage for myself and my coworkers was forced to drop all of us on the first of this year. They could no longer offer us the same deal. A comparable plan was offered, but it cost enough to put my employer out of business in less than a year after 25 years of buisness. Since I don't make a ton of money I qualify for free insurance under the new legislation. This is something a lot of poor or unemployed Americans are happy about. Not me. All of my more established or higher earning friends and family members who don't qualify for free coverage like I do are now being forced to pay for insurance premiums that are about 4 times higher and they can't afford it. The insurance That myself and my unemployed crackhead neighbor must take for free, by law, is going to quickly knock the middle class of America down a peg. I see that as a problem.", "As said, it mandates you purchase health insurance. As already existed, if you are impoverished, you can get it from the govt. But the poverty limits are low. Many don't qualify. At $60k a year a family of 4 doesn't even come close and this is a good est. of income for most typical families. The rub is that if you don't have HI then you are fined. The fines are low now but increase every year. Keep in mind if you are fired or quit and you don't get another job you could have made to much already that year and end up with fines as well if you didn't have HI for more than 60 days. It's not socialized health care at all. The propaganda makes it seem like this is the issue. It's fines for not buying health insurance. It's mandating people by something or be fined for not doing it. And it's not something that's cheap. Private individual HI can be thousands a month. Yet another part of the propaganda. .. It's not cheap. It's a two way money grab. The are also increased costs to employers and other issues for HC providers, but that's a whole other topic.", "For people like me, who don't need/have obama care, my rates went way up to compensate for the new market competition. I'm fine with paying a little more knowing that it goes towards my nation getting more health coverage, but we're talking a HUGE difference in cost. I went from spending about $3-4k a year on my family of 3 for health care, to now the cost of almost $10k. And this is basic check ups and what not. Also, I am very lucky because my company gives us an HSA with 2k contribution and our insurance rates our based on how much we are paid (Paid less, cost less) It has caused me to go from \"My son has been really sick, let's go to the doctor\" to \"my son is really sick but we definitely cannot afford to take him to do the doctor.

However everyone pays so we all, in the case we need it, can go free of charge at that moment. Dental care however, is not covered. Luckily, I am covered in the neighbouring country, where 85% is payed by the government there, so best of both worlds.

But if the temperature goes up just a little bit, some of them will melt faster than they grow, and start to shirk. That water eventually makes it to the ocean raising its level. Even worse, ice is *reflective*. When the energy from the sun hits dirt instead of ice, more of it is absorbed, and less is reflected. That causes the earth to heat even more. Finally, change the configuration of ice around the world can change weather patterns. It might not get a lot hotter where you are, but if prevailing winds change the rainfall you get, your farmland can turn to desert or swamp. Over time, even a small increase in temperature can make a big difference.", "It's not a 1 degree local, it's 1 degree global, meaning local temperatures could vary much more. I believe a 1 degree global change could mean the tropics being several degrees hotter than that. It would cause greater ice melting, as u/kouhoutek described in good detail. It would also cause the oceans in the tropical reason to be much hotter, and as tropical storms and hurricanes require certain temperatures, it would increase the frequency and intensity of those storms. Given how destructive those storms can be (Sandy, Katrina, ect), that could cost a lot in lives and money. Also, wildlife and where certain things can live is greatly effected. If an area relied on cold winter weather to get rid of certain bugs, but those bugs end up being able to stay longer, it could be worse for any plants those bugs eat.

Sort of like the human body. If your body temperature rises by one degree (Celsius), you have a fever and you are ill.

It's not catastrophic yet (the global temperature has already risen almost one Celsius degree), but definitely causing problems. The more big deal is the future change. For comparison, when the last ice age ended the global temperature rose about three degrees Celsius and glaciers covering much of Northern Europe and North America melted.

There is sometimes some cg overlay as well.", "It's been touched on, but not enough, but shutter speed and frame rate. Specifically, that films are almost always at 24 frames per second, and much TV (though this is changing) and home video is shot at 30 frames per second or 60i (60 half frames per second, essentially). Have you seen a movie on display at best buy that looked like a soap opera or live production? That's because they have frame interpolation on, which interpolates (fakes, basically) extra frames to smooth out the motion. This makes it look like something shot at a higher frame rate. Films also often use somewhat slower shutter speeds (the length of time the camera iris is open per frame) then videos, often 1/48th or a multiple of this, which gives a distinct look. Color correction and proper lighting also play major roles, along with focal depth (most cinema films deliberately focus on specific parts of the frame for effect - they don't have to though, watch Citizen Kane and you'll note almost everything is in focus much of the time).", "More factors than I could ever possibly name, being a layman myself, but just for starters: better cameras, better lighting, better make-up, and definitely better post-production, by which I mean the digital treatment of the image after it's filmed.

(Note, there exists some argument as to what the actual \"resolution\" of film is. Some people say 1 MP, some say 10 MP. But it's pretty high, and it's running through the projector pretty fast.) Sure, there are cameras that outstrip that, but not at 24 frames per second. Also, you'll see bona fide movie cameras with big-ass lenses, which allow in a great deal more light and allow much higher resolution than the relatively small lenses on a video camera or (shudder) an iPhone.

Chunks of those bits are then taken and interpreted as a sequence of numbers. A good algorithm will be spread evenly enough that it can be used as if truly random, but if you reuse the same seed value, you can reproduce the same sequence of numbers. This is actually good for computing in that you often want to be able to recreate interesting results should the sequence expose something in your program. If you want to extend it beyond computing, the idea that there is no true randomness can be reflected in that if you knew the state of every atom in the universe in any particular moment and perfectly understood the laws of physics, you could theoretically predict everything that happens from that state.", "This is incorrect. Quantum physics makes it perfectly clear that many phenomena, such as the moment an atom decays, or the polarization of a particular photon, are indeed random.", "It's hard to know whether 'true randomness' randomness really exists. We have, perhaps, one example of values which might be truly random, which are measurements which can be taken on the quantum level. However, it is possible that these are not **actually** random, but are just impossible for us to predict, and if we knew the starting conditions and the method by which the values are changed, we might be able to guess them. Functionally, what 'random' number generators really provide is either practically *unpredictable* numbers (in the case of cryptographic RNGs) or numbers that are less unpredictable but which are suitable for, say, games, which need to make the different possible values are all likely to be hit at some point. In the case of cryptographic randomness, they use events, such as keystrokes, the current time, packets on the network card, etc, to use as inputs to the random number generator. These would be incredibly hard to reproduce or guess anywhere else, so the numbers that come out are unpredictable and thus 'random' for practical purposes. In the case of non-cryptographic RNGs, a seed number is used as the starting point. This is often saved so that debugging can happen when replaying, say, a game to find out what values are being sent out. The RNG seed number is sometimes saved in games to make sure that reloading at the same point gets similar outputs each time.", "You *can* have true randomness.

Full-time positions are significantly more expensive for companies, as once you cross a certain threshold of hours the benefits you need to offer your employees increases. (Exactly what depends on the state.) Thus, a company may be able to save money by juggling several part-time people to meet their needs rather than employing one full time. This often puts employees in a position they're not fans of since it'll often mean they're working the equivalent of a full time load (at multiple employers), but not getting benefits like health insurance from any company.", "Companies incur more costs hiring full-time workers. They must pay for benefits, sick time, vacation, etc. These are things not mandated for part-time workers. So a company can hire 100 part time workers instead of 20 full time workers, pay them the same hourly wage but give them less hours and the overall out-of-pocket cost to the company is much lower. They also have to worry about covering shifts and people quitting less because there's a bigger supply of people on the schedule.", "The vast majority of jobs do not offer employees the option of working as many ours as they'd like. The service industry (where most low-income folks work) rarely has reliable schedules and often schedules only a week or less in advance. Which turns trying to work a reasonable amount of hours into a crazy juggling act.", "Low income folk here: my main job simply cant give me any more hours. No more work to be done (i work in a lab). Part time jobs also offer the benefit of something different. 40 hours looking at beakers and 20 looking at food is better than 60 at beakers. So dull after awhile", "There's a finite number of hours most jobs will offer to an employee. In some cases, there just isn't enough work to go around to maintain one employee for more than 30 or 40 hours, depending on the job. From another angle, employers in the US are required to pay overtime rates if an hourly employee (and some salaried employees in certain contexts) works more than 40 hours in a week, or either 8 or 12 hours in one day (I forget which at the moment). Say one employee worked 80 hours in a week. The law requires that additional hours after 40 get paid time-and-a-half, so the extra 40 hours is paid as though it were 60 hours. This single worker is getting paid for 100 hours of wages for 80 hours of work. Instead, the employer keeps their costs down - both in terms of labor and costs of operating the building (someone working 80 hours is going to be doing overnight shifts) - by hiring a second employee to work side-by-side. Now they're down to paying 80 hours of wages for 80 hours of work. There are also laws in some cases where certain benefits are required to be granted to an employee who works more than a certain number of hours per week. These benefits cost money for the company to offer. If the company doesn't want to incur *that* cost, they may hire more workers and reduce hours to just below that threshold. Again, that's a cost savings to the employer, but it reduces the income that worker can take home from that one job. --- Simply put, most companies just can't offer more hours to their workers. So, low-income workers take more than one job so they can work more hours and take home more income.", "It's typically not by choice but rather due to the lack of full-time jobs available.

I was beginning to think people were blind to this, since it could easily trigger a larger international crisis. My professor summarized it today, actually, and I will attempt to relay her ideas. The long and short of it: Islamic groups, some but not all associated with Al-Qaeda, want to establish a larger Islamic state in the western Sahara and instil Shariah law. However, many of the citizens, most of them Muslim, are not devout Muslims nor do they support such a drastic state. However, they also do not necessarily support the West, which still has remnants of colonial pretensions (see France having an Army base in Mali, it is a legacy of this older time). Many of them are armed since thy were originally part of Ghaddafi's army, and have now trucked all that high-level military equipment into northern Mali. Naturally, this does not sit will with the current government, Mali's neighbours, or the West (who oppose the Islamists for various reasons I do not comprehend as of yet, but alliances are part of it). Most recently, they took a key town smack in the centre of Mali, and, despite the UN resolution for intervention not taking place until almost half a year from now, France deemed that they absolutely had to begin military intervention since this town would open all of Southern Mali up to these Islamic rebels, especially since it has a usable airfield. it didn't hurt that France had a military base the next town over. At the moment, many UN nations have agreed to intervene, France and the United States being two of them. Canada has limited itself to training Nigerian troops who are fighting, since they refused to take an active combat role after the mess that was Afghanistan. This is controversial since the Islamic groups quite probably don't care, and see intervention as a yes/no thing. EDIT: as to Germany, I do not know.", "I can't ELI5 this.

Fast forward to present day: The Western world is entirely fed-up with the desire in many islamic countries to instill Sharia law and rebuild some sort of Caliphate. Terrorist organizations thrive in these countries and they threaten the international rule of law while committing atrocities left and right. At the same time, the United States simply doesn't have the political will to intervene in *yet another* Muslim country, let alone Sub-Saharan Africa. It needs another war like it needs a shotgun to the head. In comes France. Its status as the former colonial overseer gives it the unique ability to intervene at the behest of the Malian government. France isn't a NATO member (they left in 1966), but it still maintains close military ties with the organization. France's NATO connections allow it to intervene with some support from the Germans (sending medical support) as well as some limited logistical support from NATO countries. The French citizenry don't seem to mind because much of the fighting is done by the French Foreign Legion, which is primarily manned by foreign applicants. There used to be rules against Frenchmen joining the Legion. **But why is Mali important?** Well, the rebels in Mali are closely aligned with Al Qaeda and are members of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) which could develop the ability to plan large attacks if left unmolested. After some [unbelievably bad messaging by the rebels]( URL_0 ) in which they ransacked the very beginnings of West African Islam for being \"insufficiently Islamic\", the international community realized this was the African Taliban.

{"example_id": 25, "context": "", "question": "Why does every steam game I install need to install it's own copy of directx?", "answer": ["Running the DirectX installer is not a matter of making sure your overall DirectX install being up-to-date. Microsoft has a helper library with D3D called D3DX. You'll find binaries for this like d3dx9_43.dll in your Windows\\system32 folder. There are over 40 different versions of the D3DX library for D3D9 alone, and many more for D3D10 and 11 as well. Each game that uses the D3DX helper library is linked to a specific version. As such the game must run the correct D3D installer version that it was specifically compiled with to ensure the binaries exist. Even if a later version of the binary is already installed, that version cannot be used, and even if your DirectX install is up-to-date because you've run a more recent version of the installer that is not guaranteed to have installed all previous versions. Even worse, if a version is installed for x86 it doesn't guarantee the same version is installed for x64, so 64 bit and 32 bit games may need to run the same exact installer version but targeting different platforms when run. Furthermore, Microsoft's licensing terms prevent anyone from distributing the files directly, the only way to distribute them is to run the installer, that's also the only supported method from Microsoft to check that the correct version installed. Trying to manually check for the correct versions is extremely complicated because there are numerous files that must all be present and individual system configuration options like dll search paths complicate the situation. In addition, the dependencies and required checks may change in each new version of the D3DX runtime. The code to check correctly and repair broken installs all exists in the installer and running it is a guarantee that the correct binaries will exist when you run the game and prevents lots of bad cases where a game would fail to launch with an obscure error if a windows install was either missing the correct version or somehow corrupted in the past.

Can't say I ever had problems running games that way. That works even today, when I play non-Steam games I usually skip dx install and everything is fine.

The pope would then decide, based upon the advice and opinions of his subordinates and scientists, that life begins when the Sperm hits the Egg and therefore Abortion is wrong and Catholic teaching should reflect this. This is all done behind closed doors and this gives the appearance of the pope/Church just pulling ideas out their arse.

I don't know exactly how much force I'm using on the ball, I don't know the exact spin and angle, and I don't know what small unevenness there may be on the table and cushions. But even though I can't predict what will happen, the result is already defined because of the conditions that are present. So even in situations where we can't predict the outcome with a simple (or even complicated) cause and effect statement, events are still only ever going to turn out in one set way. Call this fate. In the case of free will, we can't explain what's going on, and we feel like we are in control, but there's not enough evidence to suggest that it operates differently to everything else we know about the universe. When all we are is a bag of water and proteins and electrical signals that interact with each other in extraordinarily complex ways, it's difficult to map out exactly what's going on, but we have no reason to believe that fundamentally it differs to snooker balls striking each other. But at the end of the day it doesn't really matter. When I'm reading a book, I know that it ends a certain way. Each character has a destiny. No character has actual free will, since the author has predetermined what they'll do or say. But it's still incredibly exciting.", "I really don't understand what people mean when they claim that having \"free will\" is important to them. What do they mean be free will? The concept is so dated - it goes back to when Descartes was convinced that the soul could commandf the body through the pineal gland. Well, for those who don't believe in souls, it's ridiculous to think this way. Every activity in my brain has a physical cause. \"I\" am a physical being. My brain and my body is me. So saying that the configuration of my brain and inputs to it determine my choices is equivalent to saying that I and my experiences determine my choices.

Most professional, academic philosophers believe that there is free will AND believe that our actions are caused our physical makeup, environment, and situation. Here's a crude version of the view: Being free isn't being uncaused. It's being caused in certain ways. It is doing something BECAUSE you desire to do it. If someone puts a gun to your head and makes you eat a sandwich, you aren't freely eating that sandwich. But ff you eat it just because you are hungry and want to eat it, then you freely ate it. Of course, what you want isn't magically free of the casual order, but so what? Choosing, desiring, and so on aren't being magically free of the causal order, but freedom isn't magical. It's a pretty mundane kind of thing metaphyically speaking, even if it isn't so mundane morally (e.g., when people want to do something wrong and do it). Harris has a less than stellar reputation among philosophers.", "Simply put, it's the truth. We don't have free will. We are a product of our genetic makeup and our environment.

I can guarantee you that this experiment will illuminate you like nothing else.", "There is a lot of debate about free will, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. :x", "LOVE TO BUT I CHOSE NOT TO READ IT", "The question of free will versus pre-determination is an ancient one, and one that I have personally devoted a large portion of my life understanding. After years of pondering the implications of the various schools of thought, I was able to prove through a series of thought experiments and mathematical formula that both states exist at the same time and in harmony with each other. While I can not explain Sam Harris theory in the manner you have requested, I can provide you with an accurate description of free will based on the physical universe without the problem of human perception tainting the process. Imagine an ancient alien race from another universe, a universe that ended it's natural life long before our universe came into being. This alien raced was advanced enough to survive the end of their universe and became transcendent beings that went on to colonize hundreds of thousands of universes. One of this races favorite past times is recording and logging the birth of a new universe. Imagine now that they record the birth of our universe in all its detail. They have defined every single element that makes up our universe, and have a complete database of it. Using this gathered data, they would be able to create a model of our universe that they could manipulate to their own end. Using the models to create a series of simulations and given enough processing power the alien race could then map out every single possible eventuality of our universe. Here's the kicker. See while they may be able to map out every single possible eventuality, they will not know which eventuality is reality until it actually happens. With nearly all the processes of the universe, the actual outcome of the reality is random happenstance. This is where the math comes in, which I am not going to get into right now, but there are several avenues of conventional mathematics you can explore that describe the random nature of our universe if you desire more information Now comes the introduction of life into the mix, and by extension free will. Life forms have the very unique privilege of being able determine the outcome of the reality around them. Understand that this alien races wouldn't just have your current life defined. Your entire life, everything you have ever done, everything you could have ever done, everything you could potentially do, has been predetermined by the physical nature of the universe. Thanks to free will however, we as living beings have the unique privilege of getting to choose which of our potential eventualities come to pass. Of course it's not quite that simple. We are not accounting for outside influence which effect the decision making processes. For our general understanding of the fundamental concepts however it's not necessary to get into that much detail. Before I end my lecture I will propose an experiment that anyone can try at home. Go to an area with some space and stand still. Now you are going to make one quarter turn in a direction of your choice. Random chance would suggest that there is a 50-50 chance you will turn left or right. For the purpose of this basic experiment we will ignore outside factors. Now make another quarter turn in the direction of your choice. Continue to make quarter turns in whatever direction you choose. As you make turns the odds of the direction of your turns will change depending on the direction you turned in previous turns. Random chance would keep your turn rate at 50-50, and most processes in the universe work in such a manner. In fact, if you have a friend counting for you, and you made 500 quarter turns while they logged the directions of your turn, and you did not keep track of your turns, then it would stand to reason that you would keep a balanced ratio of turns. While doing this you may find that the results are not balanced for you. If this is the case you may wish to consider outside factors such left handed vs right handed. Once you have defined the contributing factors and accounted for the effect they have on your ratio of turns you will see that your turns are still consistent with the random nature of the universe. Now lets bring free will into the mix. Turn 10 times in a row in a single direction. What are the odds of that happening naturally? Now do it 100 times in a row. In doing so you will become, in your own living room, an exceptional force in the universe. The odds of such an occurrence happening naturally are staggering. Eventually, if you were to turn in the same direction long enough, you would reach a point where the odds are no random process in the lifetime of the universe would naturally turn that way. Free will however makes such a process almost commonplace. Tldr - free will and pre-determination exist in harmony. If you think you have no free will turn around in a circle a hundred times in a row.", "Sam's biggest mistake is in NOT clarifying his point; that demonstrating vulnerabilities in free will, as he has done, doesn't necessarily leave us with determinism. Instead of \"pick a city or movie... now why did you choose that?\" Sam should just go \"choose to feel a strong emotion, like your first kiss.\" You can't just will emotions. Emotions heavily influence cognition. Congnition precedes behavoir. Behavior is the movement of your body. Thus, if you can't perfectly control your emotions, you can't perfectly control your body, but you can control it to a large extent. In this world you are not FREE. You are CONSTRAINED. I believe you retain a degree of control. Determinism means there is only one future for all of us: the future was determined at the beginning of time and we are simply bystanders watching it unfold. I disagree. I see us as being able to shape the future, not perfectly, and within many limits. On the first day of existence, I don't believe it was preordained that one day a race of men would become self aware on Earth and invent Cheese Whiz. If determinism is true, then Cheese Whiz was always destined to be. I think man made Cheese Whiz because he chose to. Why we like cheese is a result of evolution selecting tongues that find cheese to be desirable. We didn't choose to like cheese, but we did choose to satisfy that need creatively. Creativity is an act of free will. In American, you are not free to do whatever you want. Yet you aren't a slave. You can set goals, within limits, and achieve some of them in time. I think our brains work this way. We exert will over our bodies, despite the bodies needs and limits. We don't have free will. We have constrained will.", "*Compatibilism* is the view that free will is compatible with determinism. Sam Harris is an *incompatibilist*, meaning he believes that free will and determinism are not compatible. The two sides don't actually disagree about what happens, their disagreement comes from using different definitions of \"free will.\" The compatibilist definition of free will is that you are the cause of your actions (as opposed to someone else). So even is the electrical impulses in your brain are fully determined, they're still you, so you have free will. Sam Harris's definition of free will is the sensation we have that there are multiple ways we can act in the future, and at any point in the past, we could have acted differently than we did. Whether or not we call it free will, it's true that that sensation is an illusion. Sam harris argues that his definition of free will is the better one, because he claims that it it what normal people (i.e. people that don't talk about free will for a living) mean when they talk about \"free will.\" Why would you chose a definition of free will that doesn't imply that there are multiple ways you can act.", "Even If free will is an illusion, we're all under the same illusion. No one has the capacity to put all the variables of reality together in order to determine one's actions, so it's a moot point. So long as we're all on an even playing field such as we are now, the practical aspect of free will is perfectly intact and well. Influencing isn't controlling, and so long as that's all we're capable of, free will, for all intents and purposes, does exist. Obviously the reality is we're in a relatively discrete closed system (planet earth), so the system should be map-able and predictable. So the idea of true free will is a pretty silly notion. Although I do wonder how Sam Harris would respond to a quantum idea of human will. What if our decision making processes involve quantum superpositions? That might be a very strong argument for free will. We only think there isn't free will because we're constantly measuring so we only see discrete states.", "I think the illusion of chocie is a result of how the human brain predicts the future we see a ball rolling down next to us. we think \"That ball will roll to the bottom of the hill unless I stop it\", and then we stop the ball and then think \"*I changed the future*\" No you did not change the future. Your original view of the future, that the ball would roll down the hill, was false. It was NOT going to roll down the hill because in the future you stop it. Instead of accepting the fact that our prediction of the future was wrong, we say that we changed the future \"changing the future\" is an obvious paradox. free will cannot exist.", "Another viewpoint on this is determinism where in theory there are a finite number of atoms that composes your brain. Because it is finite, it is possible to predict every position of every atom that literally determines what you do, what you think, etc. So if you can predict the position or how these atoms act would you not be able to completely predict what someone will do in the future? In the same respect, because there is a finite combination of atoms in the brain (although massively large) then it must be limited. If something is limited can it be considered \"free will\"? It is like saying you are completely free to do anything you want, but you must stay in this room.", "It is fundamentally materialism. Everything is a physical cause and effect. If their is no soul or non-physical piece to life, than we are just the domino effect of matter. Consciousness gives us the illusion of free will but are ultimately bound by the past; our brain makes decisions based on it's experience and it is all probability. Personally i think this is bullshit. We make choices, we are something beyond a biological robot. I'm not religious, in fact I base this on the study of neurology and psychology, but a freewill is essential to all creativity, experience, and consciousness itself.", "I think there are 2 main issues. 1 - it's very hard to get an exact definition of free will. 2 - if all the choices we make are actually explained by natural phenomena, then the term free will doesn't actually mean anything. As in - lets take 2 different terms. Light and dark. Dark is actually an absence of light. So now we can describe everything as light. EVERYTHING is light! Now the term light doesn't mean anything. Same with the term free will. If nothing has free will - then the term doesn't mean anything.", "This has always been the least... Useful philosophical theory for me. It's strange because, if we do have free will, why do we wonder about not having it? And, if we don't have free will, then a) why do some of us think we have free will and b) who \"sits there and controls us\"? Sounds a lot like some form of \"God\" to me, and as you may know, philosophy outlaws religion, in most philosophers eyes. They are sorta... Counterarguments. And this, my fellow philosophers, is why I believe in free will.", "Also free will is a state of choosing what you want to do. You can not choose your parents, skin color, and economic class. So it's not really free will but a state of mind. From birth you are faced with a limited amount of decisions that you can actually make.

With free will your life would be able bend around what you want not influenced by outside thoughts.", "More interesting to me are the legal ramifications.

It is terrible that Jennifer Lawrence has had her personal space violated like this, but as she is as actress mainly famed for her physical attractiveness and tendency to wear tight clothing, hopefully her career will recover from the world knowing what her nipples look like. What is a much greater concern is how just how insecure most people's computers are and how much damage publically acessible nudes will do to the average woman (or man). The fact is, anybody with a semi-professional knowledge of computers and enough determination can crack open a home pc like a walnut. Back in the stone age before the Internet, people used to worry about taking nudie pics because of the statistically insignificant worry of \"what if I got burgled?\". Considering how easy hacking a computer is compared to robbing a house, it is absolutely insane how it seems the norm these days for people to keep intimate shots floating around their hard drives.

It won't deter other cases because nobody would hear about that arrest. I know people want things to be \"fair\", but that is not how the world works. The authorities have to be pragmatic, they cannot catch every criminal that exists. They can only try their best to deter future crime with the threat that criminals may get caught and end up facing severe sentencing. For example, a lot of people on /r/thefappening are scrubbing their hard drives when a thread warned that some of the leaks contained pictures of the celebs when they were under 18, meaning they had child porn on their computer. There is very little chance of the FBI actually catching you, but because child pornography is widely known as a crime that has severe punishment, people are afraid to commit it. Catching the hackers of these celebs will be a high profile win that moves hacking crimes a little closer to this direction. TL;DR: JLaw is the Mockingjay and catching the criminal that hacked her and delivering strict punishment will set precedent for future hacking crimes and serve as warning/deterrent to potential future hackers.

First of all, and perhaps most importantly, this was a highly organized leak. Most cases of leaked nude pictures are from ex-partners or the occasional stole phone. While that's horrible for the person who's victimized, this **is** different. The leaks were probably obtained by a substantial hacking operation. Public figures were targeted and the pictures sold on the online black market (also known by the now popularized term \"deep web\"). This wasn't a case of someone forgetting to put their album on photobucket as private, this is looking more and more like an organized group of people making their way into very specific people's cloud storage accounts. Obviously these people need to be stopped before they illegally access and leak more pictures, since it's clear they have the capacity to do so. The fact that these pictures were sold, not just posted online, makes it a lot worse. The crime is also worsened by the fact that these people were public figures. The pictures got massive attention, spread to millions of people and ruined the actresses carers. The economical fallout for these people are probably in the range of millions of dollars (might be hard to get a role in the next Disney movie if your sex tapes are available online). Financial loss (not financial resources) makes a difference when it comes to our justice system, and rightly so. Also, as this is a highly publicized leak it adds pressure on the FBI to actually act, as people will be demanding these hackers be held responsible. If not it will damage the credibility of the FBI and the government. So we have these factors to explain it: - Massive leak - Highly organized - Profit-driven hacking - Hacking into a system were millions of people store sensitive material (call them dumb, but that's how it is) - Massive fallout and economical loss for the victims - Big pressure on the justice system to find and punish those responsible due to massive attention and outrage over the leaks. The FBI does, as some people have pointed out in this thread, also investigate cases were ordinary people's pictures are leaked online. Those cases and investigations just don't get the same attention. Just because this is the first time you've heard about the FBI doing an investigation doesn't mean its the first time its happening. To all the people complaing, I ask you this: Would you have thought higher of the FBI if they failed to investigate this? Should actresses not be protected by the law because they have money? Should the gravity of the situation not matter when deciding how much resources to spend on an investigation? Because this is a grave situation, far worse for the victims because of their careers.", "Quite simply, the FBI is only charged with investigating federal offenses, and hacking is a federal offense, whereas posting naked photos of a woman without her consent is generally only going to be a state offense. == Federal Offense == Congress passed the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in 1986 to criminalize hacking. The relevant portion of the CFAA makes it illegal for someone to \"intentionally access[] a computer without authorization or exceed[] authorized access, and thereby obtain[] . . . information from any protected computer.\" [18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)]. The Act defines a \"protected computer\" as any computer that is used in or affects interstate commerce (because under the Commerce Clause in the Constitution, Congress only has the power to regulate interstate (not intrastate) commerce). But basically any computer that conducts functions over the internet meets this definition. So the tldr; version is that it is a federal crime to gain unauthorized access to nearly any computer system. The punishment includes a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. [§ 1030(c)]. == State Offenses == There are two general types of state laws that a woman could use if naked pictures are posted of her online without her consent. **(1) Voyeurism statutes.** Voyeurism statutes prohibit recording or taking photographs of someone without their consent. These statutes include a boyfriend who captures stills when having \"phone sex\" with his girlfriend over Skype (without her knowledge) and later posts them on the internet. **(2) Revenge porn statutes.** Revenge porn statutes prohibit posting sexually explicit photographs of people without their consent. These statutes were designed to stop the phenomenon of ex-boyfriends getting \"revenge\" by posting naked photos of their ex-girlfriends on the internet. Many of these statutes would cover any non-consensual posting of sexually explicit photos. Some only cover posting naked photos with the \"intent to harass.\" [ URL_0 ] tldr; If it is illegal at all, posting naked photos of someone - without her consent - is going to be a state law issue, which the FBI does not have jurisdiction to investigate. In contrast, the current leak raises issues of whether iCloud or another major computer system was hacked, and hacking was made a federal offense in 1986, so the FBI has gotten involved. They are investigating the hacking, not the posting of the nude photos. Sidenote: Many revenge porn statutes do not limit themselves to the original poster. If you repost naked pictures of JLaw, depending on your state, you are potentially breaking the law (since her publicist has made clear that JLaw did not consent to the posting of these photos).", "More often than not they use the term \" hacking \" they being various porn sites and authorities etc.. and in reality the majority of cases are women that sent nude pictures to a boyfriend/girlfriend at some point that person then put those pictures on the internet. The second you give some one else some thing like this its no longer your property and the other individual can do what ever they want with it, its not right but it is a fact. Many cases are also people that sell or trade in old phones with out wiping them etc.. Im not saying true hacking events like this don't exist because they do, how ever compared to the other two examples I listed \" real hacking \" is almost never the case. people just say it is because they're embarassed etc.. Now to give you an answer. Authorities get involved with cases that have \" high profile individuals \" simply because they have money any one can say other wise but it's bullshit lol.

The problem is that it is impossible for the FBI to thoroughly investigate *every* violation of this federal law (or every other federal criminal statute, for that matter); instead, they investigate high-profile violations to make it seem like they're doing something. It's akin to how the Prohibition agents dealt with violations of the Volstead Act; alcohol was sold *everywhere*, generally in the open, but they only had the ability to go after the high-profile cases. Is it unfair and arbitrary? Yes, it most definitely is. The problem isn't necessarily with the FBI's choice on how to use their finite resources, however; it's Congress's fault for passing an obscene number of (vaguely-written) criminal statutes that result in arbitrary enforcement.

In fact, we should be having a debate about a vast number of federal criminal statutes...", "i am going to guess that most of the time, the photo is not acquired through hacking. so the FBI is probably looking into the hacking case, not the boobie case. if one hacker got your credit card number and one hacker got ashley judds boobs, and the FBI only investigated Ashley's boobs, then the case could be made that rich ppl are getting preferential treatment.

For months I was battling with a hacker trying to get into my accounts, after changing passwords I finally decided to delete all my email and facebook accounts. I had my iCloud enabled since I thought it would be beneficial to not have to constantly be plugging my phone into my computer. I never understood why this hacker was so set on hacking me, I'm not famous nor do I have any interesting pics on my phone unless they liked pictures of my dogs. Finally one day without any notification that my account had been compromised from apple I came home from a late night shift and when I logged into facebook and saw that an image of myself had been posted using my account, the image was pretty much harmless it was a picture I had sent to my mom asking her opinion of a dress I was going to buy, but what it said made me sick. They had posted the image with a caption similar to \"look at my perky tits in this dress\" it was just a shock to see my privacy invaded that way. The worst part was that they had to have gotten the image through my iCloud. The image in question was only on my phone in an imessage between my mother and I and I had deleted it right after sending it to her, the image then pops up on my facebook months later. I proceeded to call apple and ask what could be done and the man on the phone blames me! He tells me that I need to be more careful about what I post online (I never posted this image anywhere online) and that if I don't want people to see certain images I should't take them. I was totally thrown off guard he was denying that my account with them had anything to do with it. Since then I have kept my iCloud off and don't use photo stream.

It is unjust - no nudes should be shared without consent at all and if they are they should all be investigated, however just because celebrity nudes are investigated ore thoroughly does not mean that they should be investigated less to make it equal, it just means that cases that aren't investigated should be investigated more to make it equal. No one is 'entitled' to more justice, it just happened that this situation highlighted issues with services which were meant to be secure and the photos reached millions.", "The FBI does not like to be involved in \"small potatoes\" crime.

I've spoken with agents after a number of hacking attempts, and they want to quantify the damages, below about $5000 and they will not call you back, below about $50000 and you'll get a lackluster response. I don't know how you value the damages of a leaked photo, but I imagine they value a leaked photo of Jane Nobody at about $0.50, while celebrities can easily document what they are paid for photo shoots, offered for playboy, and so on to substantiate that their leaked photos did \"hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage\". Plus what other folks said, celebrities have connections and can make a ruckus in the press, and they do investigate many non-celebrity crimes you just don't hear about them.", "Our culture tends to shame women who have sexual adjency. When a regular person's privacy is violated, the underlying subtext is that she got what she deserved and she shouldn't have been doing that in the first place. If a famous woman's pictures are leaked, in addition to the shaming, our culture also percieves this as a theft due to the potential economic loss. Basically the public woman's body has been turned into a commodity of sorts. And so that violation of privacy is percieved of as a theft. Both of these attitudes are misguided and sad, in my opinion, but i see both floating around the last couple of days.", "Partially that. Partially also because, as a celebrity, they get a lot more media coverage than an average person, so the FBI gets more heat for a celebrity (that has the media on their side) compared to an average person. The bigger issue is this: there were dozens upon dozens of hacked celebrities. This implies that there was either one genius hacker, or a ring of them, and they're accessing information that they should not be able to access to. The FBI is concerned because this \"celebrity nudes leak\" exposed that this ring of people/one genius exists and they have to track them down.", "USUALLY, the FBI is concerned if the crime committed across state lines. Guessing someone's password (or if you have downloaded the numerous other databases leaked onto the net with First  &  Last Names, Addresses, Emails and Passwords, unhashing the password) is not considered a federal crime (this is actually a misdemeanor from my studies during Journalism). As someone stated earlier, this is a big copyright issue and breach of privacy. The FBI must step in because the women in question are 1. Famous, 2. Not all in California, 3. Rich, 4. Friends of friends of their bosses.", "I imagine part of it is that a celebrity's pictures will spread posts of \"Famous Actress Naked Pictures!\" and news will quickly get back to them, whereas pictures of unknown girls can be put up where they will be viewed but not noteworthy among all the other naked pictures and often assumed to be put up by the subject herself, as often happens. Since word likely won't get back to these girls, often the perpetrator himself will be the only one aware that a crime was committed.", "I think the simplest answer is because of the profile of the victim. Since more people can identify the person, it becomes more obvious if the FBI is doing their job or not for everyone. So much like if you were a cake maker and a huge celebrity wanted a cake, youd make it the best damned cake you ever made because the profile of the client warrants more notice for you. If you flub the order, guess who isnt looking so hot ever again.", "another big part is that its true what a lot of people say, celebs in this country are our version of royalty. You know that M1-5 would be on it like white on rice if nudes of princess Kate were leaked. So there's that. Also, Jennifer Lawrence is a huge, money making franchise now.

But the fact that so many people important to the film industry are involved, it becomes somewhat of a financial concern. Not to mention the scale of it. There're quite a lot of people involved, so it becomes much easier to rationalize the use of resources than having everyone investigate something every other week. I'm not saying it's right, I'm just saying that's how it is.", "I think a lot of it has to do with the difference between 'hacking' and 'I left facebook open on the work PC'. Most regular women who end up with their homemade pornography on the internet don't get 'hacked'. They made a stupid mistake giving someone the chance to invade their privacy. These actresses used good security, which was hacked by a very clever motivated individual.

{"example_id": 34, "context": "", "question": "What exactly is time?", "answer": ["**Like You Are 5:** You are *always* moving through Time at approximately the speed of light. When you speed up, you begin to move through time less slowly. This is why it is technically possible to time-travel (though we can only go into the future at this point). Therefore, Time is our relative experience of moving through the fourth dimension. We can alter it by going faster and faster. If you were theoretically to accelerate yourself to 99.99% the speed of light, you would experience time-travel, where a few seconds go by for you, and perhaps tens to hundreds of years go by in the 'outside' world. **Like You Are 12:** When people call time \"the fourth dimension\", they are being technically correct. Basically, try to imagine the following in your head. If I wanted to, using some coordinate system, find a specific moment in space and time, I could write it as so: (X,Y,Z,T) where X,Y,Z are the dimensions you are familar with (height, width, depth). It is important to note that our distinction of X,Y,Z are completely arbitrary and based solely on our perception of the world. For the sake of this next part, just imagine that moving from place to place is simply moving in some direction (let's just say X). Time is the fourth dimension, as stated above. Essentially, what makes time 'time' is the fact that at this very moment, you and I are both moving through the 'time' dimension at *the speed of light*. Now when I move in the X-axis dimension (which again is an arbitrary direction), I am taking some of my speed away from Time, and giving it to the movement in the X-axis. If you want a visual, imagine a compass in your head where the needle is pointing straight ahead. In this image, you are sitting still, but still flying through time at the speed of light in the Time direction. When you start to move in any other direction (e.g. our spacial dimensions), you start to take some of your speed away from the Time direction, and give it to the spacial direction. Visually, this would look like the needle on the compass creeping left/right away from being perfectly straight. If I am on the space station moving 5 km/s, I am moving a tiny fraction of the speed of light. In the above compass scenario, my compass needle is slightly to the left/right. Thus, I am moving more slowly through time. This is why you have probably heard of something along the lines of time-travel and astronauts. Astronauts who spend a sufficient amount of time on the space station come back to Earth having aged ever so slightly less (I am talking microseconds less here). This is, again, because they were moving in the spacial dimensions at a fraction the speed of light. Thus, in the Time direction, they moved ever so much more slowly. Our perception of time stems from this phenomenon, which now that you have reached the end, I am proud to say that you now understand the bare-bones basics of Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity.", "Hoboy. In my metaphysics class (and no, that doesn't mean metaphysics like astrology and shit - it means \"relevant to the works written by Aristotle after the Physics\") we spent about a month on this. Basically there are two perspectives in the philosophical literature, called the A theory and the B theory. The A theory states that \"time is a thing that goes\", that there is such thing as \"now\" and objectively the universe moves from one \"now\" to the next. Special relativity and other evidence from physics suggests that this can't be true. So, instead there is the B theory, which is more akin to \"time is a thing that *is*\", or a dimension along which to exist just like space. In the B theory it's hard to understand why the present moment is special, or more real than other moments. I think we are only capable of experiencing each point along the time dimension as \"now\", so even if all times are effectively simultaneous, we still perceive them in a linear fashion. I wrote a five page paper on this...it's buried within the depths of my deceased computer, back in my natal home, where I am not. I wish I had some way of calling it back up, but I guess I don't. Edit: I found a copy buried in my emails! Let me know if you happen to be interested. It's not a very good paper, but it's an introduction to some very cool ideas.", "Oh boy. There are a few ways you can think about what time is. Simply, time is the change from one event to another. There is a concept called the \"arrow of time\". I find this idea helpful when thinking about what time is. Basically, time flows in the direction of disorder. What I mean is, let's say you build a house. A nice, orderly, clean and crisp house. Eventually, over many years, that house will slowly decay and crumble and at some point, collapse into rubble. It went from an ordered state to a more disordered state. That's the direction time flows in. If time didn't pass, that house would never collapse (one could argue that it would never have been built, but...meh). I may edit this later. I found this question a little tougher to describe as I began typing. Just think of it using the \"change from one event to another\" definition.", "This thing all things devours.

{"example_id": 35, "context": "", "question": "how was the first prpgramming language invented? What was the name of the language?", "answer": ["It depends when you start calling it a programming language. At first it was all programmed using \"machine code\" by putting just numbers. CPU was designed to distinguish some of them as \"operation codes\". For example when CPU read number 123 it knew it should read 2 more bytes and then add them. This was a bit difficult for programmers to write and read, and prone to mistakes so programmers started using mnemonics and software that would then translate them into machine code. Eg instead of putting an operation code 123 you would put \"ADD\" word. This was then called assembly language. It was still working on CPU level, but the code was more readable and easier to write. Later people realised that some operations are used frequently and always looks the same, so they included them in the translation software / in the compiler. You would just put a certain keyword in the source code and it would be replaced by appropriate assembly code during compilation.", "Theoretically, the first programming language predates modern computers and was made by [Ada Lovelace]( URL_0 ) in 1842 when she described the first algorithm for a machine.", "A few possible answers. The very first programming language used to write programs for computers was Assembly. It's incredibly \"low-level,\" meaning that it is not very different from the resulting \"machine code\" that the computer can read and run. A language called Short Code came about in the late 40s that was similar, but made some things easier. However, it wasn't \"compiled,\" but \"interpreted.\" Basically, instead of turning it into machine code once and always having it be in that form afterward, it was read and translated every time the code was run -- making it incredibly slow. The first proper \"high-level\" language (meaning it's further away from machine code and easier for us to understand) was called Autocode. Basically, it was a fair bit easier to write than Assembly, and when you finished writing it it would be \"compiled\" and the result was the program in machine code form. This gave access to both easier writing like what Short Code offered and fast execution like what Assembly offered.", "The first \"programming languages\" were just manuals. Imagine a calculator - you program it by typing it the right sequence of numbers and signs and if you do it right it will tell you the answer to your program. Just like the microwave makes your food just right when you give it the right input. Of course a computer is a bit more complicated and the resulting programming language is called machine code. But programming on that basic level is really hard. Soon people thought about how to make programming easier and the result are our \"modern\" programming languages. The important difference is, that computers don't understand the programming language. You need a translator, the compiler. It basically takes your easy understandable programming language and translates it into machine code. Probably the first commonly used Programming language was Assembly language, it is very rudimentary and close to the machine code. Nowadays it's rarely used, usually only for applications that take too much time if not programmed perfectly on machine level."]}

A steam turbine could be called a \"windmill for heat\". Unfortunately the efficiency on steam turbines (or all engines in general) depend on the temperature difference: you have to have a heat source and a heat sink. The heat sink is typically at ambient temperature, so the temperature of the hot side limits the overall efficiency. But we don't have abundant heat *at very high temperatures*. We have areas where the ground is hot (we use those in geothermal power plants), and we can build arrays of mirrors to concentrate sunlight (you can imagine that this is not cheap to build and does not work at night). Other than that we have to burn fossil fuel or split atoms to create concentrated heat.", "Thermal systems need a heat sink and a heat source. Basically heat flows from hot to cold. For a Carnot engine, which is basically any type of heat engine the efficiency is based on the absolute temperature of the hot (source) compared to the cold (sink), In most situations the source and the sink are too close together to generate any USEABLE power. You can generate small voltages from temperature differences, but it is not usable. generally it only enough to determine the temperature difference between the two.

The world was also a lot harsher then. Food was scarce for just about everyone (even the wealthy) until about 200 years ago so stealing food means that you can kill someone else via starvation. Stealing a cow means you have prevented a family from getting milk, stealing a horse means you have prevented someone from travel which can be a death sentence in many places, etc. Theft was not something minor when resources are scarce.", "Prisons are luxury only rich countries can afford, and in the past, no country was rich enough. Punishment tended to be quick and often permanent. The lucky would get a flogging, branding, or mutilation. The rest would be executed or exiled, which usually amounted to the same thing. Also, punishment isn't just about the seriousness of the crime, it is about deterrent. Horse theft was often a capital offense, not because it was as serious as a murder, but because it was easy to get away with. Without the threat of harsh punishment, certain crimes would occur so often society could not function. Finally, in many feudal societies, local nobles had the right and obligation to dispense justice in their domains. There weren't elected politicians representing the people, it was one person's opinion whether something was harsh or not."]}

A required step involves freezing fish at temperatures of -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius) for seven days, or frozen at -31 degrees Fahrenheit (-35 degrees Celsius) for 15 hours, which kills any parasites (since these thrive in warm temperatures). * Salmonella on chicken rarely enters the meat itself, but rather thrives on the skin. Chicken sashimi (toriwasa), is often braised or seared on the outside before being chilled as above both to kill lingering bacteria and improve the texture. tl;dr: people do eat those meats raw, but not much in the US Edit: after more research, I have learned that raw chicken is rarely eaten in the US not only out of custom but also because our manufacturing process leads to high salmonella contamination (compared to chicken abroad)...", "Former parasitologist here.

Even the worst person in the world deserves an advocate who will work to make sure they're treated fairly, no matter the circumstance. Justice is blind, after all. Of course, that doesn't mean that the lawyer will always try to *win* the case. In a lot of cases, the best defense for a client is to fight for a plea deal: in that case, the client is admitting guilt, but for a lesser crime, or in the hopes of a more lenient punishment.", "One of the important roles of the defense attorney in an obvious situation that goes to trial is to ensure that the prosecution follows all the rules we as society have placed on the government to limit it; because we, as a society, delegate the government exceedingly powerful means collecting information and punishment. If the government can't prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, without cheating, the client shouldn't be punished because there's a risk that a government that could cheat the rules could use them to punish innocent people as well. It's the defense attorney's job to protect society from the government by forcing the government to show it's work every single time.", "If it really is \"obvious\" then the lawyer will likely liaise with authorities to negotiate a deal, or recommend a guilty plea and try to avoid the maximum sentence. Nevertheless, criminal defense attorneys don't exist solely to prove the innocence of their clients. They are there to ensure their client receives a fair and just trial. The prosecution has incredible resources, unlimited legal knowledge and experience, and will do anything to collect evidence, prove guilt, and sentence their client, so the *only way* for a fair trial to occur is if the defendant has a representative who will do the same for them.", "I think about it a little differently. I think of a defense lawyer as a person who makes sure that the prosecutor is doing their job. In order to convict someone of a crime, the prosecutor has to convince 12 jurors that this person did it beyond a reasonable doubt. If there were not defense lawyers then the prosecutor could press charges on anyone. So, a defense lawyer may not see himself as someone who defends the guilty, but perhaps as someone to make sure the innocent stay out of prison. Even if they think or know their client is guilty, it doesn't matter. They have a legal obligation to find holes in the prosecutor's charges. Perhaps they didn't get a search warrant properly (as an example). And perhaps because of this, they found the killer's weapon in his house with his fingerprints on it along with a video with his confession and him killing the victim. Well, we all now know that he's probably the killer. But you can't just go around searching people's houses all willy-nilly. So, now the defense lawyer might be able to have this evidence thrown out. The prosecutor and/or police may have done a crappy job of getting a search warrant, but by the defense lawyer holding them accountable, we can feel a little safer that no one can just come search our houses without one.", "I'm a criminal defense attorney. Even if the evidence against your client is strong that still leaves a few options. You can often attack the evidence pre trial and keep it away from the jury. In the past, I've run my trial theory past some of the non-attorney office staff and they'll ask a question which I'll answer \"you won't get to hear anything about that\". It can frustrate them, because they think it's important to guilt or innocence but keeping damaging information out of evidence is a big part of my role as an attorney. They'll have to decide without that information, if they can't, I win. If evidence is based on science, you can sometimes attack the validity of that science. Experts can be expensive, and juries sometimes think the defense expert will say anything because he's being paid, but if used properly they can be very effective. If there is any question as to the constitutionality of how the evidence against a client was obtained, you can always try to have it suppressed. A successful suppression motion can acquit the guiltiest of clients. Witness identifications can be flawed, there's a lot of good science out as to that, you can't convict him if you're not sure he's the guy.

Even if it's a so-called \"obvious\" case, individuals still have the right to have the correct procedures followed, have the right to be treated properly, etc. etc. You don't just get to throw out all proceedings because someone looks \"obviously\" guilty. The lawyer is supposed to do what they are always supposed to do. Use their judgement to determine what the best course of action is for the defendant and help them reach that goal. If it was truly 'obvious' that might involve making a plea deal to avoid all the court costs, or striking some other form of bargain like testifying against accomplices or something. If it goes to court, then the lawyer's job is to defend the client by pointing out anything they can that appears incorrect / faulty in the prosecution's case or how that defendant was handled by the police etc.", "Henry Rothblatt, once F.Lee Bailey's partner, once famously said to a newspaper that 90% of America's lawyers are incompetent.

If the judge gets mad or threatens them, that's how you'll know they are doing their job. It's important to make those objections in case an appeal is necessary. In my case it was not.

If you're in real trouble, first rule, never talk; that's what your 5th amendment is for. Go to jail, take the preliminary lumps you have to take, but don't talk.

The majority of police are fair and civic minded people that are doing a difficult, demanding, and dangerous job. The police are the government in its most literal sense. However, people have a fundamental (Constitutional) right to be free of unwarranted governmental actions. Defense attorneys prevent the police for kicking in your front door and arresting you simply because they feel like it. Defense attorneys prevent the police from beating a confession out of you. Defense attorneys prevent the police from planting a bug in your house or tapping your phone (en masse) and then sifting through the tapes later to find crimes. The police are no different than any other people in that the police try to accomplish their jobs in the simplest and quickest way possible. Consider the power wielded by a person with a badge, a gun and zero oversight. How can you protect the innocent in that world? Our system has checks and balances for a reason. Those checks and balances apply at all levels of government action. These checks and balances protect the average/innocent person too. Every officer has had a bad beat. Every officer has crossed a line and learned a lesson the hard way that they can't do what they did and win a conviction. The most effective way to teach this lesson to the police is by allowing a guilty person to go free. Good police teach each other these lessons and honestly try to avoid repeating them.", "I prosecuted a case today of a guy who shoplifted a bunch of food and toiletries from a local grocery store. The evidence of his guilt was overwhelming. The defense attorney chose to have his client plead guilty, and instead focused his argument to the jury on mitigating the punishment as much as possible. The Defendant had a long list of prior petty crimes, and I made the case that he wasn't getting the message and needed to be given a jail sentence to learn that enough was enough. The defense attorney successfully made the jury sympathize with the Defendant based on his life experience, and got them to give him only a fine. The fine was more than 1200% of the value of what he stole, but he kept his client out of jail.

{"example_id": 46, "context": "", "question": "The history of Canada", "answer": ["Technically, we are 'constitutionally independent', but we are not a republic. Technically, we are a 'Dominion'. This means we are self-governing and can make up our own minds regarding national and international issues and how we involve ourselves. Prior to this, we basically had to do whatever the crown told us. (ie. Go to War.) It also often made Canadians second-class citizens in the eyes of the English (ie. 'from the Colonies'). Currently, our Head of State is the Queen (or Reigning Monarch), represented by a Governor-General, and his/her Lieutenant (Pronounced 'Leftenant') Governors, one for each Province/Territory. The GG's role is... nominal at best, but is maintained for the sake of show and tradition. In reality we are government by Federal Provincial and Municipal (where there are some) governments. The head of the Federal Government is the Prime Minister, who is elected from within whichever party has the most seats (not always the majority of seats, though presently, the current government is made up of a Conservative Majority). The provincial governments are similar, with both federal and provincial govts. made up of multiple parties which generally boil down to: Liberals, Conservatives, NDP (Moderates... ish), Greens, and Bloc Quebecois (think ethno-centrists whose platform is largely based on separation of Quebec and Canada). Provincial heads of government are 'Premiers'. Municipal governments are based on towns, counties or both, depending on how the province is broken down. Federal law trumps Provincial which trumps Municipal. We elect our government by party, not leader (though its often pretty clear who the leader is going to be), and seem to do it very frequently. That said, we are still a commonwealth country and enjoy certain benefits and relationships as a result. As for the broader history of Canada, its a rich tapestry woven from many different cultures, though predominantly the Scottish, English and French (see Quebecois and Acadian, for a start), as well as, obviously, many, many Native ethnicities. Much of Canada was opened up by the fur trade, and the associated industries that sprang off them. Wiki The North West Company and/or the Hudson's Bay Company (they eventually merged) - The HBC is the world's oldest corporation, and at one time basically owned the majority of Canada. Their industry essentially recruited natives to provide animal furs in exchange (often at outrageous and exploitative rates) for Western and/or manufactured goods like linen, knives, axes, tools, guns, sugar, flour, etc. Western explorers also pushed back the boundaries of the frontier by exploring Canada via waterways; travelling in the native fashion with canoes and portaging where they could not. Eventually this was fleshed out completely by the railroad, which ultimately spanned Canada East to West, and opened up additional resources, such as timber, Gold (and other minerals) and linked the two sides of Canada. Traditionally, this railroad and its many, many assets were owned by Canada Pacific Railway, which, like the HBC, is now, sadly, a shadow of its former glory, though that glory can still be seen in the hotels they erected along the way, such as Chateau Lac Louise in Alberta, the Chateau Laurier in Ottawa, and a few others I dont remember. In terms of military history, Canada has an excellent war museum, in Ottawa, which is worth visiting and sums it up nicely. In brief, Canadian warfare has (chronologically) included a variety of conflicts with the natives, the French - who had originally colonized much of Canada but were essentially kicked out by the British, especially at such battles as the Plains of Abraham and Louisbourg. Many of the French were exiled back to France (despite being multiple-generation 'Canadians'.) others were resettled, giving rise to pocket communities like the Acadians in Nova Scotia. Canadians also fought in a variety of other international wars, including in Russia during the revolution there (though IIRC they didnt do too much), the Boer War in South Africa, WW1 and WW2. In WW1 they accomplished incredible things at terrible costs; more Canadians died in WWI than WWII. For highlights, look up Vimy Ridge (an entrenched fortification held by the Germans that had held off (and slaughtered) everyone else for years, that the Canadians essentially took in a day, by using their heads), Passchendaele and many, many others. In WWII Canadians fought alongside the British from the outset, in Africa, and later in Italy, France and Holland - which they later liberated. Most Americans have heard of the Normandy landings; what most dont know is that the landings took place on five separate beachheads. The Americans took one two(Omaha and Utah) the British, with the Free French, took two (Sword and Gold), and the Canadians took the Fifth (Juno) and most heavily defended. We also burned down the White House once. **edit1 - adding more detail**", "Canada was initially settled by France and later Britain invaded and they took that shit but the French population stayed and kept their delicious poutine.

We spent a lot of time in history class talking about the difficulties of settling in the provinces and suchlike. * In the early days, when we were a french colony, the King of France wanted his colonies to flourish, so he sent over lowborn girls named the filles du roi (\"king's daughters) to marry colonials and create families. * [Samuel de Champlain]( URL_0 ) is known as the \"Father of New France\" and is the founder of Quebec City. * The Coureurs-du-bois (Runners of the woods) were French trappers who fueled the fur trade. They learned the languages of the Aboriginals, often married them, and spent their lives in the woods trapping game and taking it back to outposts to be sold. * Jesuit Priests from France came over to convert the Aboriginals to Christianity. * Agriculture under French rule was pretty much Feudal; A \"seigneur\", or lord got the majority of your crops as payment for letting you farm the land. * [Louis Riel]( URL_2 ) is something of a folk hero for the Metis People, and was hanged for treason. The Metis are Part French, part Aboriginal, likely descendants of the runners of the woods as mentioned previously (The french and the aboriginals had a better relationship with each other than the brits, although this might be a matter of discussion) * Britain and France eventually squared off against one another over Canada in the [Seven Years' war]( URL_1 ). The General for the British side was General James Wolfe. The General for the French side was the Marquis de Montcalm. They both lost their lives in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The British won. * In the war of 1812, we sided with the British against the Americans. This is the war in which we burned down the white house, which later had to be rebuilt. Anyone care to tell me which side the french fought on? * Nowadays, the desire to separate from Canada has subsided in Quebec, as evinced by the fact that the Bloc Quebecois won a pitiful one seat in the last election. Although rumour has it that some right wing nutjobs in Alberta are also looking to separate... * When we talk about the different provinces and territories, we like to separate them into broad groups. Like the Prairie provinces are made up of the three central provinces: Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Then you have the Maritimes, which are New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. You have the three Territories, which are the North West Territories, the Yukon (where the gold rush happened) and Nunavut (a newly formed territory, the primary purpose being to give those regions more political representation. I think that's the reason, feel free to correct me on that). Ontario and Quebec are big enough to merit being on their own. And British Columbia is the pothead province, apparently. Does anyone know how the french revolution affected Candadian governance, if at all? Or had the governance of the country passed to Britain by then?"]}

They rely on the fact that most people sit too far away from their TV to even properly tell 720p, so upscaling everything to 1080p just gives them advertising rights to say that it is in Full HD. For special films they actually go through and can basically rebuild everything. Really what they are doing is building visual effects that look identical. This was used extensively in the 4k work on Taxi Driver. For this they focus almost exclusively on the places that are in focus, since that is where you will be looking. It is only the major artifacts in the background that are redone. This is simply to save a lot of money. The basic work is very quick and inexpensive, a full movie can be done for under $5000. The more in depth ones cost far more, the Taxi Driver 4k was alleged to cost roughly $100,000. Edit: It occurred to me that you may want an explanation of how the film scanning works. Start with the sensor from a DSLR camera (we will change this later). Now if we can lay the film precisely on top of the camera sensor, the sensor will see the film and we get the image. The problem is that sensors are actually very rough microscopically and touching then destroys them. We need something to protect the sensor. On top of the sensor we place a very precise lens system. Film glides over glass very well, and now we don't touch the sensor. So we precisely align a single frame of the movie on the lens over the sensor. Shine a very precise amount of light through and we capture the image perfectly. For modern celluloid this can be done at 18 frames per second, for highest quality, if speed is important 48 frames per second are possible. For old fragile celluloid the speed is slowed way down, with very old films I have heard of speeds as low as 1 frame every 5 seconds. So that's the basic, and is how the \"cheap\" ones work, cheap here is $20,000. However with some changes we can greatly improve quality. The first, most common, change is to replace the sensor. Instead of a Bayer pattern sensor, like a DSLR has, we use a prism with 3 sensors a sensor each for red, green, and blue. Now we get a full resolution image for each color. This is probably the most widespread method. However, if we sacrifice some speed, and use the latest LEDs, we can reduce cost, and maintain quality. Remember in our first setup we used a color sensor. Instead use a black and white sensor. Black and white sensors are the sharpest, most accurate, most reliable sensors available. Now we get a black and white image. But if we shine just a carefully controlled red LED through the film we will get just the reds information. We do the same for green and blue. Now we have three images for a single frame, one each for red, green, and blue. This is basically the next generation technology for film scanning. It offers greater control, the highest quality, and is the cheapest price. Once all the individual frames are scanned. Then the scan goes through color correction where a skilled technician carefully adjust dozens of parameters to deliver the correct color for the film. This colorist job is standard across both digital and film capture.", "On actual film, the particles make greater than what 4K is now. Granted, they are particles and not pixels but the are so sharp that the displays that show them have to \"dumb down\" or reduce the clarity because nothing yet has been able to totally show that clarity. That's why movies always showed \"this has been formatted to fit this screen\"", "**tl;dr**: Film is worse than you think, but that's OK: movies don't *have* to have good quality in the individual frames. Digital encoding helps. There are other ways to fix up movies and photos with digital image processing, but a five-year-old doesn't need to know them. The simplest answer is that you just take a high resolution digital image of each frame of film or old photograph, and then scale it down to the pixel resolution you want. The other answers here are pretty good, miss some important things about film. Photographic film *can* have very high resolution, but generally doesn't. In any case, film resolution is quite different from pixel resolution. Film works by being covered in a random pattern of tiny light-sensitive crystals. Those crystals get \"activated\" by light. Later, you \"develop\" the film. The main part of developing is bathe the film in certain chemicals that turn the crystals dark. The \"activated\" crystals turn dark faster than plain old \"unactivated\" ones, so if you bathe the film in the chemicals just the right amount of time, then an image will appear. There are other chemicals to wash away all the leftover non-darkened crystals, which makes the image permanent. The deal is that *each crystal on the film develops all at once, or not at all*. That is, if enough light hits a particular crystal to turn it dark, that whole tiny crystal turns dark during development. Black-and-white film has one kind of crystal, color film has three different kinds that respond to the three primary colors. So there's a trade, in film, between *sharpness* and *greyscale*. At very small scales, developed black-and-white film looks like a bunch of black specks sitting on a piece of plastic. At larger scales, you can see an image with different shades of grey. The grey level is decided by how many black specks there are in each little bit of film inside the grey area. The sharper the details you look for, the less clear the grey is and the more grainy the image appears. Movie film is particularly bad for grain. That is because the film is exposed for a short amount of time in (often) low light conditions, so movie makers use a sensitive film. Individual frames of a movie from, say, the 1970s (like \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"), stored at 1080p, often have a *lot* of visible film grain. But in a movie that's not so important: the frames flit by so fast, your eye sort of averages out the grain from nearby frames, and the movie looks great at 1080p even though each individual frame may have enough grain to really only look smooth and good at 240p or similarly low resolution. MPEG-encoding movies helps get rid of film grain, too! MPEG format uses *differences* between frames and stores the information as a combination of cross-fading and bulk motion of the image. Since MPEG is a *lossy* compression scheme, the encoding throws away a lot of \"non-essential\" information in each frame. The non-essential information is small, faint features that are completely different frame to frame -- which is a good way to describe film grain. So MPEG encoding actually helps clean up film grain and make the movie look \"cleaner\" even at 1080p."]}

Unfortunately, even if that neon \"FREE CAKE\" sign has been taken down, and the cake has been hidden away in a fridge somewhere, when you walk into the room, you might see some other cake indicators, such as paper plates, forks, napkins, and milk. Once you've gotten that much info, you might start thinking to yourself, \"Hey, there might be cake here.\" The same happens with the bugs.

{"example_id": 56, "context": "", "question": "With all the lawsuits going around where companies can't be sexist when hiring employees how is hooters able to only hire big breasted women", "answer": ["They are hiring models. It is legal to base hiring of models on physical characteristics. They have already been sued over it and won. Edit: Well I didn't think my short comment would be the at the top. Hooters lost the overall case and had to settle. However, they retained the right to maintain their hiring standards on their female wait staff. They opened many other positions to males as part of the settlement.", "Legally, it's what's called a \"bona fide occupational qualification\" that hooters waitresses must be female. The federal law that protects from employment discrimination says that you can refuse to hire someone based on their gender if their gender is that specific to the job. HOWEVER, Hooters has to be willing to hire male cooks, busboys, etc, because those jobs are \"behind the scenes\" and so are not protected by the Hooters = women thing. Basically, it works because Hooters' entire brand is based on hiring women as waitresses. Doesn't mean they can get away with never hiring men for OTHER jobs, and doesn't mean any restaurant could get away with it. If I had a restaurant that was 100% branded to be all about hot guys, I could legally hire only hot guys. But if I had a regular coffee shop that wasn't marked as a hot guy coffee shop, I could not legally refuse to hire women. ETA: Race is not a BFOQ, so no, you can't refuse to hire someone based on race. It's not going to fly. ETA 2: YES, EVEN FOR A MOVIE. As I have said below, race is not a BFOQ even for movies, but physical characteristics associated with race are okay in some circumstances, and yes, it is a big complicated mess. When the law was passed in the 1960s, the Senators who wrote a sort of guide to the law (which does not carry the same legal weight as the law but is considered by judges interpreting the law) said while the law says race is not a BFOQ, physical characteristics that go along with race might be in the case of a movie. Later judges have said that this means you can't base your hiring of actors based on race, but you can based on physical characteristics. In the words of one judge, \"A film director casting a movie about African-American slaves may not exclude Caucasians from the auditions, but the director may limit certain roles to persons having the physical characteristics of African-Americans.\"", "They don't 'only' hire women with large breasts.

Similarly, you can discriminate against black females if you're casting for a movie and you need a white male. You can discriminate against paraplegics if you're hiring an acrobat. You can discriminate against Jews if you're hiring a minister for a Methodist Church. And you can discriminate against people over 50 if you're hiring a child model. Hiring is a intrinsically discriminatory process. Companies discriminate against people who are unqualified, lazy, late, poorly dressed, combative, rude, violent, thieving, et cetera. Congress passed various laws to restrict discrimination based on certain characteristics. Primarily, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 covers age-related discrimination. And the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 includes disabled persons. The federal government doesn't prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but many states, including California, have laws in place prohibiting it. When passing these laws, however, Congress knew the realities of employment, so it created exceptions in the form of BFOQs, in case the discriminatory characteristic is necessary for the function of the job and cannot be reasonably accommodated without undue burden. The courts are always in a position to be skeptical if an employer tries to stretch the limits what can be considered a BFOQ.", "Simply put, human rights panels across both Canada and the US agree that if a workplace can provide justification that hiring otherwise would negatively affect their bottom-line then it is fine to have hiring practices like this.

{"example_id": 59, "context": "", "question": "What is it like to have a sense of smell?", "answer": ["I'll use hearing as an analogy, since it's closest in my mind. Imagine that every chemical in the world made its own sound. I don't mean like the difference between the musical notes A# and D, but like the difference between a flute playing A# and a blender with rocks in it. Smell is that rich and complex of an experience, compared to the simpler colors  &  brightness of vision. Like sounds, you can smell things over long distances without direct line of sight, and it's hard to completely block out, even if you pinch off the pass to the organ sensing it. Some smells drown out others, and some come through clearly no matter what (like a baby crying). Some smells are pleasant and stir emotions (particularly primal ones like hunger, lust, and safety), and some are incredibly annoying or even painful. Some differences are that you filter out background smells faster and more completely than sounds; you don't usually smell yourself at all, whereas you do hear a distorted version of your own voice always. It's harder to be overwhelmed by odors unless they come from gasses that cause other physiological effects (e.g. ammonia), whereas deafening sounds will cause permanent damage. It's hard to impossible to burn out smell from overexposure to non-toxic chemicals. On the other hand, bad smells can make it hard to breathe and make you nauseous. I can only imagine eating without smell would be like watching a movie without sound and subtitles. Maybe you can get a general feel for what people are saying by watching lips (so long as they face you), but you miss out on the effects of the background music for setting mood and all the foley effects. [Edit: Missing a word.]", "Smelling is a function of the brain, as you know. It lets me know I am alert. It taps into the primal part of self. I am able to place locations like certain streets or kitchens by smell. I can know the scent of another person and know that they have been. It comes about unexpectedly, one minute I have smelled the same smells for one hour and with a single breath I am introduced to a foreign scent without my approval. But sometimes I smell a smell I am expecting. Like my farts. I love the smell of my farts.", "for want of taste, smell is best compared to touch. a truly foul odor is very much like having a mild acid in your sinuses. courtesy of menthol and similar compounds in cleaning products, things that smell \"clean\" are best compared to a feeling of cold.", "It's a subtle bookmark for places and events that so instantly take you back to a memory. Smell is the nostalgic sense", "How had your loss of taste affected your diet? I've often wondered if it would improve ones diet if they could suppress thier taste senses, as it would (in my theory) eliminate any eating based on cravings.", "Many of the responses here deal with the emotional response that smelling something produces. I think that's good, but I prefer digging deeper, since there's still a link in the chain there that's missing, and that is the actual physical perception of smell. I'm sure that you know what it feels like to have the emotional experiences that the people are talking about, so that isn't explaining anything that you don't already experience or know, so a more detailed description of how the stimuli presents itself to your awareness is in order, I think. /u/pyr666 does a good job of comparing it to touch, since that makes a link between your experience of touch and what it feels like to smell. Maybe that's just my take on it though, since I can understand how all sense is in a spectrum and that they cross over from time to time (I'm a mild synesthete). To me, extreme hot and extreme cold are similar to white, which are similar a loud trumpet playing its highest possible note, which is similar to very strong and distinct tastes like pure lemon. To me, they all share the property of being \"high energy\" because they present themselves to my awareness such that I'm keenly aware of them and they can't be ignored. In the same way, some smells have that same kind of spectrum of \"can't ignore\" - they \"shock\" your nervous system - often in a specific way. A very bright point of light to your vision is like a sharp needle to your touch, which is like a squirt of lemon juice or wasabi to your taste, and perhaps like vinegar to smell. That's generally what sour smells (and tastes) are like. Then there are those at the other end of the spectrum - tastes and smells that aren't overpowering, but that you need to pay attention to your sense to make it known to your attention. This is like the smallest amount of hair on your arm being moved but you just barely register it in your sense of touch. Similarly, colours that are hard to distinguish such as very pale colors or very dark colours may blend together and not be as distinct or catching to your awareness. In terms of smell, you might say this is like the smell of something fairly muted, like the smell of paper or sand. Bitter, as both a taste and a smell, to most people, is not pleasant if too strong, and might even be said to be painful and presents itself to your awareness with a kind of sense of immediacy, like being overwhelmed by looking at the sun (that sense of needing to look away), or pull away in the case of getting a deep papercut. Sharp spices like cinnamon are like having the blood flow back into your hand and you get pins and needles - many tiny bursts of individual neurons. Like the tickle you get in your nose when you're just about to sneeze, but milder and more diffuse. For more complex smells, such as where someone invites you to try to smell the different \"notes\" in a wine, it usually has a very strong sensation of one sort (usually the alcohol or the sourness of grapes) which makes it very difficult to make out the other smells - like trying to pick out the clarinet with a tuba blaring beside it (one drowns out the other, or makes it necessary to search harder for it). Some smells \"feel\" pleasant, like silk caressing your skin (such as the smell of butter or vanilla), or \"warm\" like the feeling of warmth on your skin after being out in the cold (such as the smell of freshly baked bread). These smells generally produce an immediate effect on your body of making your muscles relax, or to feel tingly all over. Similar to medium-saturation warm colors like yellow, orange, and red. Blue and green colors are like fresh coolness on your skin, which is the same as \"cool\" smells. The coolness of the sensations is also a relaxing one, often. A cool smell is like mint, pine, citrus because they seem to \"reset\" your sensory pallatte and don't linger long. A cool mist on your warm skin will seem to numb your skin very slightly and then cannot be felt soon after.", "to smell is a gift and a curse at the same time. Overwhelming scents can be devastating such as a skunks spray while others such as the aroma of a fine wine can be uplifting.", "I read an article about a woman who had a magnet in planted in her finger. This resulted in a new sense where she could feel magnetic flieds (like microwave ovens, high voltage lines, etc.) and detect near by metal. Thinking about this completely alien sense helped me to consider my other senses more objectively. So being able to smell actually gives you information about the chemistry of objects. Consider all the chemical reactions that take place in cooking; they result in differnt smells (and tastes). Smell can also tell you if fruit and vegiyables are ripe or even spoiled. Likewise of meat goes bad it give off a smell - kind of a warning. So you can think of that as being smiliar to being able to see or hear that information - since you get it from a distance. It it probably more similar to hearing since it doesn't require direct or uninterrupted \"line - of - sight\". Off all my senses, smell is the one that most often conveys bad information. For like in the case of spoilage, the smell is revolting. Like a loud sound, or a bright light. Smell is a really strong trigger for memories too. For many people smelling cookies reminds them of home. Or maybe certain foods remind them of holidays. The part of the brain that processes olfactory (smell) information is closely associated with memories. Because smell gets stronger the closer you get to the subject, it often times draws me in for smells I like (good food, a woman with nice colonge, the smell of the woods, etc.), or drives me away for ones I dislike (spoilage, feeces, filth, body oder, too much fragrance, etc). As a parent of small children, smell is one way I know my kids needs a clean diaper. Often times he\\she will get cranky (audible) or show other visual signs. The smell is another queue. My mother in law has no sense of smell, so she would always stick a finger in the diaper to veifiy - which is messy. I just look when I am unsure. Generally speaking smell is a way we learn things not to eat. There are some poisons that are adapted to smell good or not at all, but very few things that smell bad that are good for you (individual tastes aside). So smell is just another way to collect information at a distance from the world around us. Most of that information can be collected other ways too. Especially if you took chemistry and have isolated different compounds and elemtents. Smell is just a convenient way to do that.. Edit: hit post early.", "A good smell is like feeling something very pleasant and soothing. It often elicits memories, as smell is very strongly tied to memory, and you may find yourself back in a happy childhood memory. The smell of bread in the oven would immediately transport your mind back to being a small child, helping your grandmother bake in the kitchen and feeling like the world was amazing and the day would last forever. It's a very visceral, all-over feeling when one is enveloped by a familiar, pleasant smell. You feel your body open up to pull it in, your eyes close and you salivate involuntarily, and everything around you slows just a little bit. Think of it a little like being in the afterglow of a good orgasm. Conversely, a bad smell is not as often tied with memory but creates a very physical response just the same. You'll feel your throat close as you gag, and your stomach churn or heave. The smell feels viscous and heavy in your mouth, as though it's tangible and you've bitten down on it. It seeps into you, burns a little, and feels thick and wet in your throat like you're choking on something slimy. Smelling something bad is like trying to swallow a mouthful of lukewarm eggwhites when you're already so full from eating that you're rather nauseated.", "Hey!

If you're interested in this kind of stuff, check out the book \"Selling Sickness\"", "In the United States, prescription drugs are like any other product and marketing them directly to consumers is the fastest way for them to establish a foothold in the market over their competitors. With new drugs, doctors often don't know about them as they have not gained broad acceptance in the medical field.

Can you go to the store and by these medications on your own? No, you must have a prescription from your doctor. can I buy granola bars without a doctors prescription? Yes. So the reasoning in the original explanation is flawed. The reason why the advertisements say, 'Ask your doctor about a certain prescription' is so you can go to your doctor and ask for their prescription vs. the competition. Also why are more than half the commercials dedicated to talking about all the side effects while the narrator speaks in an increased speed than when he is talking about possible benefits?", "I hope I am not falling on my own sword but... Edit: They are not necessary but can be informative. There are over 6k drugs approved by the FDA in the US. That is a lot of drugs, and that does not include many oncological drugs. Before advertisement many people did not know there was help for them. Take people with active bladder issues. Before 5 years ago only 5% of the population took medications to help them. Most people just learned where all the bathrooms were. Now there is actual study and medications to help. IBS for many years was thought to be \"in the mind\" of the patient and now we have real medications to help people with their issues. The stigma of AD(H)D has been lessened with many information out there and various treatments to help children and adults. Many adults who suffer RA have more than two options. At the end of the day the most important aspect of humanity is choice. How do we make decisions without all the information? Commercials can help people learn they are not alone in their problems and seek help. Not all drugs are a fix, but sometimes they are necessary. There are so many ways to help people manage their illnesses, not just by drugs mind you!, but by knowing options and what your condition might be. Sometimes a person can have an issue, see the doctor and it is something else but at least they saw the doctor. Sometimes medications are not needed just a lifestyle change.

Better sources are input from peripherals (such as your mouse and keyboard), traffic from the network card, and seek times from the HDD (SSDs don't help here because they are too predictable). Those sources aren't perfectly random. For example, keypresses from the keyboard aren't typically random: they generally follow a pattern (such as writing words in a given language). But they are not fully predictable. You then use this source of entropy to seed a [pseudo-random number generator]( URL_1 ).

We look down on teachers (those who can, do; those who can't, teach), and in many states, only require teachers to have an education degree, rather than a degree in the subject they are teaching (this is not necessarily bad for those teaching younger students, but can be problematic once you get past elementary school). * Our schools are structured to teach compliance and make good workers, rather than developing creative thought or even fact-based knowledge. We focus on obeying rules (dress code, zero tolerance, don't be late for class) and observing a strict schedule (move to the next class at the bell, not when you're through with the material) - these things make good workers, but they don't necessarily reward thinking (and sometimes discourage it - if you're stuck working on a problem and the bell rings, you have to give up and move along, rather than getting the reward that comes from solving it). [Washington D.C. spends more per student on K-12 education than the rest of the country ]( URL_0 )(PDF, page 26 and 29), partially because they have fewer students than most states, but also because many of the public school students have low SES. Other states, like Mississippi/Alabama/Arkansas/Missouri, don't spend nearly as much but also have terrible education outcomes. That said, it also depends how you measure education spending. If you're throwing college costs in, you're going to skew the numbers high for the US, because it costs a lot to go to college here, and the state isn't paying all that much of the costs anymore. If you measure state funding, you're leaving out places that use local tax $$ to fund schools (and thus have very wealthy and very poor districts). It's also very difficult to compare countries across even uniform testing measurements, since populations differ so much - the US has much higher social inequality than Finland does; is it really fair to compare our education scores directly knowing that the US has many more students who face challenges due to home life (and not the educational system directly)?", "Is that more per student, per capita or simply more than other countries in total? Are we talking higher education alone or primary and secondary education too?", "There's a few flaws with this rationale. First the assumption is, if you have more funding you get better education. These two things are not really related, see all kinds of statistical data on poor nations doing well in this area, failed funding in developed nations in education etc. There's a lot of precedent for this. Secondly we can not look at education as a stand alone entity. Culture is a complex sociopsychological system. Many many factors may drive the quality of education, not just the methods and abilities of the educational institution, but also the values and expectations of a culture, the ideology behind it, the current paradigm of the culture as far as education and its goals and so forth. You couldn't even ignore less sociological factors like diet and health, the biological aspects of the environment.There is literally an infinite, but still examinable number of factors. In the specific case of the USA I think its a huge cultural problem. Peoples values, expectations, morals and world view are getting more and more skewed. To put it differently, people are scared and confused and don't know what to do. The problem is, that this happens on every level of society and the ramifications of this are huge. The rampant materialism also doesn't help. We rear people to be obedient workers who's main value is production, consumption and material gain. When you do this at the expense of all other facets of humanity you get something that's oddly out of balance. I've only given a few examples, but this is a very complex issue. The main problem with modern society is that we look at aspects of it (education, health, politics etc) as separate entities. Thus when symptoms arise, in our overzealous quest for productivity, instant solutions and instant gratifications, we try to cure those instead of realizing the problem lies deeper and not in the symptom. This creates a whole new set of problems and unforseen consequences. Its not simple. That's why we have a hard time as humans. Its not simple and we lack the wisdom to recognize this. Nothing stands alone it will always be part of a system. If your culture is healthy so will be your educational system, if its corrupt, twisted, ill or confused it will manifest symptoms of this illness on every level of society.", "TL;DR Fix funding inequalities and watch our test scores catch up to the rest of the world! People make the mistake all the time of conflating education spending with federal education spending. The Fed government spends only 0.8% of GDP on education. It spends around 3.8% on the military. States and municipalities chip in the other 5%GDP or so that we spend. Make no mistake, this is a huge number. It also means jack squat for test scores if the money isn't spread evenly across school districts. So guess what? It isn't at all. States and municipalities do a horrible job of distributing money evenly to school districts. We fund schools in an extremely disproportionate manner. 23 states spend more per pupil on rich pupils than poor pupils. Let that sink in. Taxpayers spend more, in 23 states, to educate the children of the rich.  URL_0  Live in an economically depressed area? Good freaking luck finding a decent public elementary school for your kid. I can't think of another first world country that concedes so much decentralized power to its states and counties for education. It comes down to two major issues: 1) Poor school districts are a huge drag on education scores because their districts barely have enough money for facilities and salary, let alone technology. The richer districts are essentially Scrooging their way to more tax dollars and hoarding good staff, equipment and buildings. (Performance-based funding only exacerbates this problem. Telling a school it won't get more money if its students don't perform well in an already unfair system of funding creates a predictably bad outcome.) 2) A modest attempt at creating national standards for education has failed miserably. States HATE federal education intervention. Don't know why really. Every other country I can think of with a decent standard of living uses their national government to manage education.", "The truth is we **don't** really lag behind most other countries. The thing is, many other countries when testing students for international rankings, only test or submit the best, where as the US submits almost every score. Adjusting for socio-economic factors, US students tend to perform as well or sometimes better as most other countries, and comparing specific states (NY, Mass.) that are strong on education, to other countries, we can see they perform very well too. [This]( URL_0 ) article explains it very well. Another example was the recently released technology literacy exam. The article posted to reddit stated US scores were 'abysmal'. Yet if you looked at the data; the spread for most of the top countries was within 10-15% and the US, while toward the lower end of the top countries, was within 5% of most other western nations. I would not call 5% 'abysmal'", "I assume you're looking at reports like [this one]( URL_0 ). A couple of things to note about that study: it includes spending by students and parents, not just the government, and it includes college. The numbers are probably skewed, therefore, by our ludicrous higher-education costs.", "There's always the question of what do you teach kids, some states teach \"science\" from a very religious and strict way, this will mean that later on these students won't be as likely to get into college or score well against foreign counter parts.", "At least in higher ed, most of the money goes to the administrators and sports."]}
{"example_id": 64, "context": "", "question": "Why do dams have a massive ramp when releasing overflow water?", "answer": ["Spillways are generally used in emergency situations when you need to reduce the water level in your reservoir FAST. The water released has huge amounts of energy, as you can see in the video. Think of all the damage that water can do when it reaches the bottom. If you just had a ramp straight down, the water would reach the downstream riverbed with huge amounts of energy, and start pushing away the soil and rocks at the bottom (causing erosion). But, so what if that stuff gets pushed away? Well the dam is a really heavy structure that's supporting lots of pressure, and so it requires a good base to stand on. If this erosion goes uncontrolled, the dam can become unsupported and lose stability, leading to a collapse. This would be catastrophic for anyone/anything that is downstream. (You can google dam collapses, that shit ain't pretty). With this in mind, spillways are designed with a big curve at the bottom called a 'ski jump'. The purpose is simple: to dissipate all of that energy flowing downstream. And tbh it also has the added benefit of looking super cool.", "The biggest danger for a dam is undercutting, where the water flowing down the face of the dam swirls around and eats away at or under its base. But designing a spillway to direct the water away from the face of the dam, you reduce or eliminate that risk. Throwing the water into the air also gets rid of a lot of the energy of that falling water. It transmits a lot of it into air that is pulled into the foam, and the air takes the energy away as wind. Lastly, the water in a dam has often been still for a long time, and has lost a lot of its oxygen and gained some sulphur chemicals. That oxygen gets added back in, and the sulphur dispersed, by mixing in a lot of air like this. This isn't as important with spillways, but it is with dams that release water from pipes at their base.", "Same reason that when I am pouring water from a 5 gallon bucket into my fish tank I have to make sure I pour it over the rock structure in the tank so the gravel doesn't get shot everywhere and my fish aren't left with a giant crater. ^_^", "I actually just watched a show on the science channel about the three gorges dam in China. The reason the ramp is there is so the water can separate in the air and the energy dissipate so as to not dig out the base of the dam.", "Spillways can have baffles, steps, or a ramp in them as a means of dissipating energy. By slowing down the water, there's less erosion of the riverbed right behind the dam.", "Does this affect the wild life at all? Like there has to be a ton of fish going off that ramp and being moved to a new ecosystem down river.", "Water coming down a dam has a lot of energy. You could use that energy to make electricity. Some dams aren't used to make electricity. Other dams make electricity but sometimes need to release more water than they can use to make electricity. If the water was simply released downwards, it would erode the river bottom, and maybe even erode under the dam and weaken it. The ramp is there to use up some of that energy and make the water hit further away from the dam, to protect the dam.", "Essentially, if the ramp wasn't there the water would erode the area just below the dam. This could cause the whole dam to fail and come crashing down.", "From /u/runningturtle6 [original post]( URL_0 )  > It's a phenomenon called hydraulic jump. The spillway is designed this way so that the water's energy is dissipated before entering the river. This helps prevent erosion and a torrent of fast moving water rushing downstream. I believe the dam is partially built on the area where the water would hit so if you erode it, you'd be eroding part of the foundation of the dam itself. Further in the comments it is debated whether this is a \"hydraulic jump\" or not.", "There is no greater force on earth than moving water en mass. You have to protect the channel, or you'll be carving the basement down further when releasing energy in this small a space, at this high a volume.

{"example_id": 65, "context": "", "question": "Can alcoholism actually be \"passed down\" from an addicted parent, or is it just a sorry excuse people use to keep being alcoholic?", "answer": ["I assume ELI5 actually means explaining like OP is 5. So I'll give it a shot. When someone says *passed down*, they typically mean transferring a trait from parent to child. There are 2 ways this can happen. **Environmental factors** (these are things that are *outside* the body. Like home-life, parent-child relationship, type of friends, role models, all that good stuff)  &  **Genetic factors** (things that are *inside* the body. Like genes and...well mostly just genes) The potential environmental factors are obvious, so I'll spare reddit the details. Genetic factors are a little more complex. You see, the mechanism of **addiction** is in the brain. But not just in a person's thoughts and/or feelings, but *literally* in the brain. In the pink tissue inside our skulls, there are tiny receptors (think of a baseball glove) that *catch* tiny neurotransmitters which are chemicals created and released *by* and *to* other brain tissue (think of tiny baseballs). Now, drinking alcohol, for most, makes a person feel good, right? When the brain feels good like this, it releases baseballs to their respective baseball gloves. However, overdoing this will cause the brain to create more baseballs than gloves. But the brain is basically a god-damned 3d printer. So it just creates more baseball gloves for the extra baseballs. Here's where the plot twist comes in, and where alcoholism rears it's head. These gloves don't *just* catch baseballs. They catch all kinds of balls as well, such as tennis balls (seizures), golf balls (hallucinations), and ping balls (death). An alcoholic, then, has to KEEP drinking alcohol to make the brain continue to release enough **base**balls to fill up the available gloves and to prevent these random other balls from entering the gloves. These gloves have always been able to catch these random balls, but since there was always a limited number of gloves, the chances of catching a tennis ball in the middle of a baseball field was always highly unlikely. So addiction comes down to too many gloves catching the wrong balls. Now, the most common way this happens is by the pathway mentioned above: a person drinking way too much and then causing the brain to make shitload a gloves. However, genetics has a role here too. There are some folks who's brain's 3d printer is way too efficient and is programmed to build more gloves quicker. In other words, in these folks it would take less drinks to cause them to become full blown alcoholics. Also, genetics can affect how *good* a glove can catch these other balls. So if you're brain's 3d printer is building Hyuuuge gloves, then obviously that person's glove will catch more random balls. Genetics can affect any part of that terrible baseball metaphor. I'd go on, but I'm sure you're getting the point. I think we've talked about balls enough today. **Serious Note**: So, no. It's not a sorry excuse for some people. It's a real disease. Hey, from personal experience, I know how problematic dealing with alcoholics can be, but they deserve empathy and patience. Some of them were just dealt a bad hand.", "The genetic variance for alcoholism is often estimated at 50-60%. Genetic variance, however, is a weird concept. Here's an example I like a lot. Assume there's only two things that influence lung cancer: Smoking, and genes. Now, let's go to a city where literally everyone smokes, and 20% get lung cancer. Because smoking doesn't vary, 100% of variance is due to genes. Sure, smoking actually caused it, but it doesn't explain why some people got it and some didn't. So genetic variance doesn't tell us what most people think of when they hear that something is \"50% genetic.\" So what genetic variance tells us here is basically something you might observe anyway: Lots of people drink, and only a minority develop a strange and uncontrollable pattern of drinking. Some of this is explainable with genes, some with life history and environmental stressors, and some is mysterious. Questions of free will, I leave to the philosophers. What I can say is that alcoholics are not lacking in willpower--to the contrary, they're capable of tremendous persistence. The problem is that it's been progressively channeled towards getting another drink. Incidentally, while some gene variants increase risk for alcoholism, some actually decrease it. Some East Asian populations have high rates of a variant enzyme involved in breaking down alcohol, producing rapid facial flushing and other unpleasant symptoms after drinking.", "You can be genetically predisposed to alcoholism and addiction. In addition, a stressful environment as a child/adolescent can make you more vunerable to stress later in life, this can lead to depression and drinking behaviour (as a coping mechanism).", "There can be a genetic pre-disposition for alcoholism.

If you're combining gin with tonic, or vodka with something super-caffeinated like Red Bull, whose to say the drunk you're experiencing is due to the alcohol, and not because of what you're drinking with it? Despite the fact that there are no scientific studies (to my knowledge) that examine the behavioral effects that different alcoholic beverages may or may not have, the most common explanation for the differential effects of booze is that it's all in your head, and that your experience with a given alcohol is dictated largely by the social situations in which you choose to consume it. Fundamentally, alcohol is alcohol whichever way you slice it.", "In general, no, it's all just ethyl alcohol affecting you. As jhaake said, though, you can expect some differences based on the mixers you use. Red Bull will give you a different reult from club soda, because you are adding a stimulant.

{"example_id": 69, "context": "", "question": "Published papers in science", "answer": ["Normally, this refers to peer-reviewed articles published in academic journals, like [this]( URL_4 ) or [this]( URL_1 ) or [this]( URL_2 ) or even [this]( URL_3 ). Literally tens of thousands if not more of these journals exist, covering about every field you can imagine and then some. Some that are very prominent include *Science*, *Nature*, *Journal of the American Psychological Association*, *Journal of the American Medical Association*, etc. These very high-profile journals often cover a broader field, whereas smaller, lesser-known journals (like the reindeer one above!) usually publish articles on very specific subfields. These are published by private academic publishing companies like [Elsevier]( URL_0 ), or by professional/academic organizations like the American Medical Association, or university-owned companies like the [Cambridge University Press]( URL_5 ). People who read them include other researchers in the field, who usually have subscriptions through their institution. You do that because you want to stay up-to-date on what's happening in your field! \"Articles\" can be many things, but generally think about anything you might write in college/university for a class, but more detailed and on a more advanced topic. In science, most commonly they can be the results of an experiment or experiments on a single topic (kind of like a lab report), but they can also be a review of current research in a field, responses to other studies that have been published, case studies of a single patient in medicine, etc. In other fields, they take many forms...book reviews, essays on a particular philosopher, you name it. \"Peer-reviewed\" means that when you submit an article, it gets reviewed by an anonymous panel of reviewers people who are selected by the journal *who know a lot about that field*, usually other professors/researchers. This is key, because it means what you wrote has to stand up to the scrutiny of people who also know a lot about the subject. If I submit an article to a physics journal about how we're all quantum wavelengths of the divine or something, the physicists who review it will say \"nope, this doesn't make sense.\" Whether it's a valid metric is a controversial question. Certainly someone who has published tons of work in important journals has likely done a lot of important research, and also importantly lots of people have heard of their research. However, you can probably imagine a lot of reasons why \"number of published papers\" does not = \"great researcher!\"", "Each journal that publishes papers establishes a committee of experts who review the papers before they are published. There is a huge difference between publication in a prestigious journal, like Nature, and publishing in an obscure one. However, when you are just introducing someone, \"n published papers\" is enough to show that they are an academic. When it makes a difference, academics typically provide a Curriculum Vitae (CV). A CV is like a resume, but it focuses on where you studied, with whom, and it lists all your publications by title and journal. This allows folks to see if you've published in related topics or in more prestigious journals.", "The answer to this really depends on the journal you are talking about. Some journals, like _Nature_, are highly respected and are very selective about what papers they publish. Submissions are highly reviewed and must be of substantive nature. Other journals will publish _literally_ anything you pay them to publish (as an example, _Adam Ruins Everything_ got the script of one of their episodes published in an \"academic\" journal by paying the fee).", "The act of being published does not necessarily correlate to the quality of content, it just means the paper they produced was published in a journal somewhere. Publishing is an important part of the scientific process as it allows your work to reach the larger audience, which in turn allows for criticism, review, and confirmation by other scientists. Many research professors and residents are hired based on the number of publications they make per year, and the phrase \"Publish or perish\" is a common one in research circles. If your studies and experiments aren't producing results, what use are you as a researcher? Quality becomes less important than quantity at the beginning of your career when your position in the field is less stable. I'd argue that the vast majority of scientific publications are **old ideas** being verified, criticized, or altered in such a way that it becomes an important difference. For example, one paper might push the new idea of measuring time by the oscillation of caesium atoms, and then 3,000 papers will come out shortly afterward talking about that first paper in some manner or other.", "Papers are essentially articles published in an academic journal. In science, the article might be the details and results of a new experiment; in a history journal, it might be a new theory based on re-reading a ton of old documents, etc. If we restrict the discussion to science, then articles can be of several types. A common set of types are: Full papers (a long detailed description of a new experiment/trial, and its results, together with how they affect current theories), short communications (a brief description of a new result, not important or complicated enough to need a full paper), reviews (an article going through all the existing papers on a particular subject, pointing out which are good and bad, which results are reliable and which might not be, and producing an overall conclusion about the current theories, etc.) Anyone can write a paper and submit it to a journal. Editorial staff will then look at the paper, make sure it is something that journal readers might be interested in, and then find some volunteer experts to review it. Typically, the experts will be authors who have previously submitted papers on a similar topic to the journal and had them accepted for publication. However, they might also be personally recommended to the editors, or the editors may be familiar with their expertise from other journals. The reviewers will then review the paper, and make a recommendation to the editor as to whether it should be published or not. So, who reads the journals? Anyone that is interested in the up-to-date knowledge. For science journals, that would be scientists working in that field. For medical journals, it would be doctors who need to know about the latest advances. The journals are essentially a method for people to get their results and theories out to the wider world. Some are old and have a long and prestigious history, taking care to make sure that the reviews are of good quality and that the papers are interesting and important. Some, especially these days, are little more than scams which will publish anything if you pay their \"publication fee\". The older ones were typically weekly or monthly printed magazines, but these days people prefer online subscriptions; with many of the new low cost journals being online only. One of the problems with just using number of papers published as a metric, is that it doesn't reflect on quality. A preferred metric is \"impact factor\" which is based on how many times an author's papers are cited.", "So basically as far as science goes you can think of published papers as mainly a way of sharing research with other scientists. Some papers might have such a huge impact that they're read generally by all biologists or chemists or whatever, but most research isn't getting published in Nature or Lancet or the handful of other very popular journals. What happens in biomedical science, which is what I know, is that papers published in associated journals gets a unique ID and entered into a database called pubmed. As other scientists, when we're learning about something or coming up with an experiment, we use these databases to find and read all the related work that's been done. Most of these papers wouldn't be read by the public because they probably seem insanely boring, but I care a lot, for example, about a paper presenting the structure of a receptor that a virus I work with binds to. A lot of journals are behind paywalls and a single article can cost $50, so those are pretty much restricted to students and facilities with access. The other point a lot of people made already is that a lot of published papers are reviews. These are basically written as introduction to something and a review of all the prior research. A researcher with a passing interest in something can read reviews to get a general idea of what's going on in a specific area, and they're very helpful when you're starting to work with something new.", "I had started to write out a long explanation about the hierarchy and politics of scientific publications... but here's a blunter version: In academia, unless you are working primarily as a teacher at a small college or something, the *real* metric of success is *money.* STEM professors are expected to bring in big research grants (because the school gets to take half of that money for *other* stuff, but that's a whole other can of worms). If they don't, they're out. Having publications in a specific area makes it more likely for someone to get a grant on that topic because it is evidence that other experts agree that you *can* do the type of work you are proposing. Grant renewals often hinge on publications, because they are seen as signs of progress. If you had X years of funding and nothing to show for it, they aren't going to give you X more years of funding."]}

{"example_id": 72, "context": "", "question": "What prime numbers are and why they're important", "answer": ["Imagine I gave you a whole bunch of blocks, and asked you to arrange them for me. I need you to arrange them in a rectangle. Let's start with 10 blocks: ********** After messing around a bit, you manage to make the following rectangle: ***** ***** Good! Now count the number of blocks on each edge of the rectangle. 2, 5, 2, 5. Notice each number will for sure appear twice, so we only need to keep track of the two that might be different, 2 and 5. We call these numbers a *factorization* of our first number, 10. What if I give you one more block? ***** ****** It doesn't seem to fit anywhere. After a while, you give up. That's because 11 is a *prime* number, the only rectangle you can make with it is: *********** the line rectangle. Now, how about we add one more? ************ This time, you manage to make two *different* rectangles: ****** **** ****** **** **** So 12 is definitely not prime, it is composite. Why don't you try 13? What makes primes important is that you can use them to build up all the other numbers. When you have a composite number, you get two factors, two numbers that multiply to give you the composite number. These two numbers might be prime, but if not, you can factor them instead, and keep going down until you have all prime numbers. For example 10=2\\*5, which are both prime. 12= 2\\*2\\*3, all prime. So often, if mathematicians can show something is true for prime numbers, they can then show that it is true for all numbers, because every number is built up this way from prime numbers.", "This isn't really an answer, just an interesting related note. You also see prime numbers in biology. For example, the [Cicada]( URL_0 ) has a very long 13 or 17 year life-cycle. Its no accident that these are prime numbers, since it means that their predators, with shorter life cycles, can't synchronize their cycles so that they always emerge at the same time the Cicadas do. If a Cicada had a 12 year life cycle, then a predator with a 2, 3, 4, or 6 year life cycle could have a feast once every 6, 4, 3, or 2 cycles respectively.", "I think others have covered what prime numbers are quite well. Let's talk about why they're important. First, every whole number bigger than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes--and the series of primes that represents a whole number is unique. Reducing a number to the series of primes that represent it, however is *very hard*. In fact, it's so hard that we haven't come up with a fast and consistent way of doing it that doesn't depend on trying every possible combination--or at least making educated guesses. This is particularly true of semiprimes--the product of two prime numbers. However, checking if a number is prime--and checking the factorization of prime numbers is correct--is a *very* easy thing to do. We can check 300 digit prime numbers within a fraction of a second using computers! Now, one thing we can do is use two very large prime numbers to scramble messages--as all messages can be encoded as numbers. What's more, the way we scramble it means that I could hand you one number to use to scramble the message you want to send me, while I keep one that de-scrambles that message. It doesn't matter how many people know about the number I give you: as long as it takes several hundred computers two years to factorize a large semiprime (large here meaning more than 200 digits), nobody's going to calculate *my* number using yours. This process is called asymmetric key encryption (or public key encryption). Why is this important? Every time you want to make a purchase online, you want to make sure that bad guys don't get your credit card number. Websites use asymmetric key encryption to ensure that bad guys listening to your Internet connection cannot get your credit card number and take trips to Thailand with your money. Banks use similar methods to ensure that bank-to-bank electronic money transfers are secure and that bank robbers can't take their money by tapping into an Internet connection. The military uses it to pass its orders around so that enemies can't see the military's plans. Indeed, the Nazis lost the war at least in part to the fact that their message scrambling wasn't as secure as they thought. But you didn't ask about how computers were invented, so we'll save that story for another time.", "What a prime number *is* is simple enough: Any whole number which can only be divided by itself and one and still give a whole number as a result. e.g. 6 is **not** prime, because you can divide 6 by 2 and get 3. 3 however is prime, because you can't divide 3 by any whole number besides 1 and 3 and get another whole number. For any non-prime whole number, you can get that number by multiplying together 2 or more prime numbers, e.g. 50 = 2 x 5 x 5. Why they are important is a more complex issue. They have their uses in cryptography which have been explained to five year olds [before]( URL_0 ). What mainly interests mathematicians is that there doesn't seem to be any pattern to the prime numbers. Take the first few: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19, 23, ~~27~~... there is no discernible pattern to this sequence of numbers.

One pile contains carbon atoms, another one contains cobalt, and so on. These atoms are the fundamental building blocks of all things in the universe. Now let's look at a number. We grind this number by dividing it into smaller numbers. At the end, we have numbers that cannot be divided any further. These prime numbers are the fundamental building blocks of all other numbers in the sense of multiplication. This is why they are interesting. The word 'primal' is probably a better description. Primal as in fundamental, the beginning, optimus prime..al?", "There's something my brain isn't quite grasping, which is, if a given number X is the product of two primes Y and Z, then those are the *only* two primes which can be multiplied together to make X. I mean, I can sit here and go \"3 x 5 is 15; are there any other primes which can be multiplied together to make 15? Obviously not. Next, 5 x 7 is 35...\" but I don't instinctively, logically *see* that this remains true all the way up. Can anyone Prove It To Me Like I'm Five?", "A prime number is a number that can be divided only by 1 and by itself. The first primes are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and so on. Usually 1 is not considered prime. For example 4 is not prime because 4 = 2 x 2. 6 = 3x2, 9=3x3, on the other hand 17 is prime because 17 = 17 x 1. Prime numbers are infinite. It was proved by an ancient Greek mathematician, Euclid. *He said: suppose that there are only 3 prime numbers: 2, 3 and 5. Multiply these three numbers: 2 x 3 x 5 = 30, now add one: 30 + 1 = 31. This number is not divisible by 2, not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5. So there are two cases: 31 is prime or is the product of other prime numbers. In both these cases the list of primes is incomplete. Note that with this method you don't get all the prime numbers. (Like You're 12)* Finding big prime numbers is hard (even with computers). This is why prime numbers are interesting for mathematicians. They are struggling to find a way to get prime numbers easily. Now prime numbers are used to hide messages (there's a lot of theory behind this so it's difficult to make it easy) in what is called public key cryptography.

Ski boots shouldn't adapt, they should brace your foot. You can get the inner shoe shaped to fit your foot. it costs like $300-500. But a far cheaper thing that people don't know about is that you can take your boot to a (good) ski shop and they can stretch your off-the-shelf boot where it hurts your foot. About half an inch or so. It's usually like $30-80. It works out great for many people. Edit: but they ski boots are not as bad as they used to be, right?", "You haven't spent enough money for a comfortable pair", "We have. If your boots hurt they're not the right ones for you.", "They do. Spend the money and go see a boot fitter. If after a break in period your feet still have hot spots go see the same boot fitter and they'll usually make adjustments for free. Source: I have two comfortable pairs of ski boots.", "Former boot tech here. In a previous life, I fitted ski boots for a living. How many pairs? I suppose I've worked on over 200 pairs of boots. I've also been a skier for 30 years, and snowboarder for perhaps 15 years. Here are my views on the subject at hand...ski boots and the fitting there of. In normal life, people wear shoes...normally runners or dress shoes. They are soft, light and flexible and are available in many sizes...usually length and sometimes width. They are made this way because feet come in a HUGE array of sizes...I've never seen 2 sets the same...and believe me, I've seen a lot. A soft shoe, while perhaps not a perfect fit to a foot, can bend, twist and adapt itself to the foot it is on. The main purpose of a shoe for most of us is to protect the very bottom of the foot when we *walk* or *run*. Not a difficult challenge. Now for skiing, you need to basically attach a 170-190cm long board to each foot. There is a *lot* of load that needs to be dealt with here...a ski provides a lot of leverage. You can't use a canvas or plastic shoe to provide this...you need to move up to stronger materials. Ski boots are made from injection molded plastic. They need to be to transfer the energy of the skier to the skis. The boot is *rigid* but the foot inside is *not*. So the challenge here is to make the inside of the boot match the foot as closely as possible, and still be able to transfer load effectively. This is the challenge! Let's look at the extremes. Let's say you took a huge boot (several sizes too big), and filled it with soft foam. Nice and comfortable for sure, but the foam will *not transfer load*. Let's look at the other extreme...a small boot...several sizes too small. You can mash your foot in there, and the energy transfer will be great, but this boot will hurt like hell, you will have cold feet, and likely hate life. Ok? The trick then, is to get the hard outer part (the shell) to fit as closely as possible. The inside part (the liner) needs to help take up the space where things are a bit big, and provide some insulation against the cold, and manage moisture (foot sweat). Making a mold for a shell is *very expensive*. Each manufacturer uses biometric data (foot sizes) from large population samples to size their shells. Some data leads to wider shells, some narrower. Some fit feet with higher arches, some with lower. When I was in the business, Dachstein and Koflach tended to fit wide feet, while any of the Italian boots (Munari, I think...) fit narrow feet. These days, things are probably different. Also, know that the boot shell does not change for every boot size... there are normally 2 or 3 boot sizes per shell size. The shell changes dramatically at the \"jump\"... the liners will just have more or less padding. The best fit will happen when the shell all by itself fits closely, with only the smallest possible liner. The lesson here is to fit the shell first...with no liner. If your boot fitter does not fit the shell first, seek another fitter. Some liners are better than others. Some are heat moldable over time, some have variable density foam. In the end, the more performance oriented the skier, the tighter (and probably less comfortable) the fit needs to be. A common trick used by shops is to sell a boot that is too large. Nice and comfy in the store, but the skier will hate it on the hill... they try to crank all the buckles down to take up volume, and it does not work. Almost all boots I've ever fitted could use a modification. Grind the boot board down to drop it and create more space. Dremel out the toe box a bit to make room for fat toes. Cut the back down to allow better circulation for big calves. A note on cold feet. Your feet are cold because of a crappy fit, not because the \"boots are cold\". The key to warm feet is circulation, not insulation. Any pressure point on the surface blood vessels will hinder blood getting in and out of the foot. A note on putting boots on. Stand up. You don't ski sitting down, do you? Open the boot and make sure the liner and tongue are straight. Put in your foot in one smooth motion. Buckle the top buckles first (a bit) and flex the boot as much as you can. This drives the heel back into the boot. Do this a few more times, and tighten the buckles on the top. Flex forward, and do the toe buckles now. There should be minimal pressure on the toe buckles...just enough to keep the shell from flexing open. Final note, wear one pair of ski socks...preferably on the thinner side. Don't wear two pairs thinking you will be warmer...remember what I said about circulation? Feel free to comment or question. tl; dr: Ski boots are doing a much harder job than running shoes, and have to be made accordingly. Don't expect them to fit like Nikes.

If I have convinced you to buy a pair DO NOT LOOK FOR A PAIR in the nicest way you don't know what you want or what you are looking for. If you buy a pair which match your ski outfit you will probably buy the wrong ones. Go to a ski shop which have a large selection of boots and ideally research who has the best reviews for boot fitting. Go to the shop and instead of looking at the boots ask for their boot technician and explain you want a pair of boots (sometimes you will have to book an appointment, if it's far from where you live might be worth calling ahead). The boot tech should look at your feet and ask you about your skiing style and experience. They should then give you a selection of boots which they think will fit your feet and your skiing style. Once you have selected your boot they can then Mould the liners to your feet and if necessary stretch the boot as well. They should also advise you on if a custom insole is necessary and if so what type, I have high arches so this made a huge difference, this can be an extra £60-80 it's worth it.

Level of skier, style of skiing, terrain you like to ski, weather you like to ski in Number of days you ski per season Whether or not you know how to buckle your boots correctly Whether or not you invest in custom footbeds People who have never had problems with boots either have very easy feet to fit, have been fit by an expert fitter, or don't ski very athletically or very many days per season. People who always have problems with boots either have never been properly fit, or have very difficult feet to fit. When you buy from a good ski shop and are fit by an expert fitter, it typically includes as many free adjustments throughout the lifetime of the boot as it takes to get things right (cash tips always good). An expert fitter will not just measure your foot, but look at it, flex it, study your stance, and ask you questions about your skiing. And, with any new boot, you need to give it 8-10 days on the slopes with a little pain/discomfort to let the boot pack out naturally. If after that you're still not right, take it back and ask your fitter to get it right. (Pro tip: take baby steps when adjusting hot spots. Big adjustments can cause a counter issue that makes things worse instead of better: lift the heel too dramatically, now your pinkie toes are jammed. Grind out the pinkie toe too much, now you're banging in the toe box.) So, one thing at a time, and ski on the adjustment a few days to get a feel for whether it's right before you take it in again. Sometimes things just need to pack out and settle in. The most common mistake people make is buckling down too tightly to keep their foot snug in a too-big boot. This cuts off circulation, your feet get cold, your calves get bruised, your toenails get bruised, you hate to ski. For 4 buckle boots: the most important buckles are the second and third. When putting on your boot, stand up. Start with the power strap, then buckle the second buckle down from the cuff. Now buckle the top buckle, then the third and the toe. NOW GO BACK AND DO IT ALL AGAIN. Adjust the power strap again. Tighten/loosen all other buckles in same order. You should be able to pop open each buckle without too much effort; it should be snug but not tight. With 3 buckle boots, same process, but the cuff and second buckle are most important. Never tuck your pants, long underwear into your boots. The only thing that should be in your boot are your feet and your socks (and toe warmers if you need them). Long underwear should be pulled up over your knee when you're putting on your boot, and then pulled down to cover the top of the sock after your boots are buckled. Oh, there's so much more I could say about this, but I'll just say \"custom footbeds\" one more time and stop for now.", "Ok, ski instructor here, my chance to shine. Lots of people saying pay money for comfortable boots. They are missing the point a little. Top end race boots hurt. They are painful. Ever seen a racer's feet? Or a ski instructor's? Rather hideous. The reason for this, in contrast to say a snowboarding boot, is that the boots have to be stiff. They have to be made of a firm plastic in order to ski well. In fact the more high end the skiing the stiffer and firmer the boot will be (freestyle being the exception). Race boots are really hard to flex, the plastic is designed too not change to much in heat or cold and the whole boot is meant to be as tight as you can stand without doing medical damage. Of course there is room to move with in this. You can get the right boot to begin with that is more likely to fit your foot shape (wide last, narrow or wide ankles and calves that sort of thing). You can then get them molded or the inners injected and molded. A holiday skier should not be in pain, but nor will they ever feel like a slipper. To be clear again; the best top end boots in terms of performance will never be a comfortable fit. The most you can hope for in really well performing boots is that they don't damage your feet. Source: I spend hundreds of pounds/euros/CHF and thousands of hours in boots.", "Boot fitter here. The easy answer is that we have. A bunch of companies (like Salomon, Atomic, and Fischer) have relatively quick custom molding techniques that allow for the actual plastic boot shell to be matched perfectly to your foot. Moreover, ski manufacturers are getting a lot better at material science, allowing them to make the plastic stiff where it needs to be (on the sides) and relatively flexible elsewhere. Ski boots won't ever be as comfortable as skate shoes, but if you're in a properly fit boot then there's no reason for it to hurt. I also like to give a few tips for making your own boots way more comfortable: 1. Never wear more than 1 pair of socks. More than that and you'll wind up trapping moisture and making yourself far colder. 2. If it takes more than the pressure of one thumb to close a buckle, it's too tight and you're cutting off your own blood flow, making yourself colder and less comfortable. 3. Buckle from top to bottom, and kick your heel back into your boot's heel pocket. Modern ski boots have a tight heel pocket that adds a lot of support, but if you clamp down your toes first and don't allow your foot to settle back properly, you'll wind up with your toes jammed in the front, and all kinds of blisters.", "They do. You just need to buy a good pair that fits you well and let them mold to your feet. Mine have a velvet like material that is extremely comfortable. The only pain you should be experiencing is in your shins after hitting big jumps, but that's normal. Also, protip: it really helps if you shave the bottom portion of your legs if your a frequent skier. The boots get so tight around your socks that any time the boot flexes it will feel like your leg hair is getting yanked out. My legs are super hairy and I ski every other day so it makes a huge difference for me and the other guys I ski with. Plus it's not like anyone sees your legs in the winter anyway. It's a really common thing among good skiers. And if you are using rental boots, you are just asking for pain. Do some research, try some on, get the right amount of stiffness you need, then you'll be able to ski all day without taking a break.", "It depends where they are hurting, many new boots (even ones that have been fitted) hurt because the foam on the inner of the boot has not been squashed, this means that there is more pressure being put onto your foot. This is something you usually just have to grit your teeth and push through. However it may also be that the shell of the boot is too small, or may not be a comfortable shape for your foot, this can be solved by taking your boots to a ski shop where they can either grind or blow out the shells to make more room, and will usually do so for free. It is also a good idea to have a sole made for the inside of your boots as it can help reduce pain and stress on your knees if you are flat footed.

{"example_id": 81, "context": "", "question": "Why are eye colors only blue, green or brown and not other colors like purple, orange or yellow?", "answer": ["Eye color comes from the amount of a specific pigment/dye in your iris called *melanin*. Melanin is a brown pigment found in many places throughout your body, including your hair and skin. The more melanin in your skin, the darker it is. With a few exceptions (I'll get to them later), every eye color comes from a different level of melanin in the topmost layer of the iris. The more melanin, the darker and browner the eye. The less melanin, the lighter and bluer the eye. Green eyes are just blue with a slight tinge of brown. Hazel eyes are a moderate amount of brown. The reason that no melanin = blue is the same reason the sky is blue. It's an optical effect called [Rayleigh scattering]( URL_0 ). The light waves get mixed up and \"scattered\" by the tiny transparent molecules of the top layer of the iris. Blue light is scattered more than other colors, making the whole area appear blue. There isn't actually any blue pigment in the eye (or in the sky); it's all an optical illusion. There are eye colors that are outside this blue < - > brown spectrum, though. These are amber (gold-ish), gray, and violet. Amber eyes come from a different pigment called lipochrome. Gray eyes are \"cloudy\" blue eyes. The molecules in the iris have banded together into larger \"clumps\". The optical effect of this is the same as water molecules clumping together into water droplets and forming a cloud, creating a gray sky. Violet eyes occur only in albinos. There is so little pigment in the iris (not just the topmost layer is pigment-less, but the lower layers as well) that light can actually shine through from inside the eye. This gives you an eerie highlight of the blood vessels running through it, which can appear red or violet depending on the lighting conditions.", "What determines your eye color is primarily influenced by the presence of melanin in the eye. To put it very simply, melanin effectively makes things darker. Although, the colors you mentioned do exist rarely. * Brown Eyes: These are the easiest, tons of melanin! The melanin darkens the eyes to a brown shade. * Green Eyes: Melanin is present but, in smaller amounts than you would see in brown eyes. One interesting thing is that melanin still creates brown pigment, there is no actual green pigment in green eyes. The reason that the eyes appear green is because of the way light scatters after being reflected by the eye. * Blue Eyes: Very little melanin (but, not necessarily none). There is still no blue pigment, appearance of blue eyes is caused by the same light scattering mentioned for green eyes. Now for the rarer colors, including the ones you mentioned! * Hazel Eyes: Hazel isn't an agreed upon color but, hazel eyes are usually between brown and green in terms of melanin production. The light scattering explains a lot about how people with hazel eyes tend to seemingly have blue or green eyes depending on lighting. * Grey Eyes: Very little melanin, like blue Eyes but, also thought to contain collagen deposits in the colored part of the eye that influences how the light is scattered. * Amber/Golden Eyes: This would be the orange/yellow eyes that you mentioned. Animals have this a lot more than we do but, it's not unknown in humans. It's caused by a pigment called 'Lipochrome', the eyes also have melanin but, not as much as someone with brown eyes would have. * Red Eyes: Severe albinism can cause you to have near zero melanin. This can result in eyes appearing to be red in the right light. This is caused by the underlying blood vessels showing through. * Violet Eyes: Violet or Purple eyes can also be caused by albinism/near zero melanin. There is a theory that a separate genetic trait called 'Alexandrias Genesis' can cause violet eyes. Elizabeth Taylor is thought to have potentially had this trait, but, others believe it may have just been a trick of the lighting. There are a tremendous amount of positive traits connected to 'Alexandrias Genesis' that make it seem like pseudoscience, it is most likely just a very mild case of albinism. **tl;dr**: Eye color is primarily determined by melanin which works on a scale of less brown - >  more brown. Extra colors are caused by light scattering combined with the brown of the melanin but, some other factors exist to produce rarer eye colors.", "I saw an African American female back in the early 70's at a department store that had gray eyes. I've never seen anything so beautiful", "There's only one color that's ever present in people's eyes and that's brown- it's the same pigment that makes people's skin dark.

People with brown eyes have a lot of pigment.", "Eyes are blue, the move through different colors towards dark brown the more melanin is in them. They are blue for a similar reason the sky is blue.

{"example_id": 82, "context": "", "question": "Why isn't getting checked for cancerous tumors, or tumors in general, a routine process?", "answer": ["The problem is that there are very many downsides to routine checks. Too many downsides, in fact. First of all, we do not have the resources to preform routine checks on everybody. In many places, there are already long waiting lists when people need certain types of scans or care. If we tie up our limited amount of scanning equipment and personnel that can use these machines and interpret the results with millions of people who don't even need them, the waiting lists will only get longer and longer. Secondly, body scans are not magic. They can detect if there are irregularities in your body. They cannot immediately detect whether this irregularity is something to be concerned about or not. Most of us have irregularities in our bodies that are absolutely nothing to worry about, just a result of how we aren't perfect beings and don't grow perfectly. If everybody gets routinely scanned, all of these irregularities are going to pop up and doctors will pretty much be obligated to investigate them further. Even though 99% of them are absolutely not any danger to you. That means more tests (so again, more strain on our limited resources) and also means more stress Which brings me to point three: quality of life. Basically, routine scans do not improve quality of life. In rare rare rare rare exceedingly rare cases, they might detect something slightly earlier than it would otherwise have been detected. In most cases it is going to detect harmless irregularities, which will lead to people having to undergo more (and sometimes painful testing), which they will have to wait longer for due to the longer wait lists, which all accumulates in a huge increase in stress. All to tell you something they knew already, namely that there is nothing wrong with you. Basically, the very marginal benefits of a system like this do not outweigh the much more common adverse effects (all the extra stress and pain of tests that people will experience and the added wait time to everybody else who *does* need these tests and might be in a worst position due to the long wait), so we don't do it.", "Several scenarios. One. You don't find any tumours. That's because you haven't got any. Doesn't mean you won't get one I'm the next month or year. But since a doctor has told you then you feel safe. But you shouldn't. You don't have a tumour TODAY. Two. You find a tumour. Great. Except not all positives will be right so you just gave a lot of people drugs, worry and surgery who did not need it! Three. You don't find any tumour, but you missed it. So that's a waste and false security for the patient. Four. You find a tumour and they have cancer. The rarest of all the outcomes. Also it's hard to find a tumour when there are no symptoms. How many people had to be screened and at what cost? And what about the increase in radiation exposure or the minor surgery to have a look? Both have risks and you cause more harm in doing the screening than the number of people caught *who wouldn't have been caught later when they had symptoms*. It's also very hard looking for rare events in a huge population. And quite counterintuitive. It's actually a fascinating area  URL_1   URL_0 ", "Finding them can be difficult and/or expensive. Why don't doctors run a full scan of every conceivable system and perform every test? It's too expensive, painful and time consuming. We don't have the technology to be proactive, so often we have to be reactive.", "Diagnostic imaging physicist here. This is a lot more complex of an issue than it sounds. For starters, checking women that are middle age and older for breast cancer IS a routine process. Women over 50 are recommended to have mammograms (breast x-rays) every six months. Any kind of program like that is called \"screening\", and since it involves radiation, there are a LOT of legal guidelines. In the US it's regulated by the FDA, a purview enabled by the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA). I do safety checks on mammography machines, and let me tell you, they are a real pain in the butt. Not because mammography is complicated - it isn't, compared to other types of diagnostic imaging - it's because the FDA takes any program where (usually) healthy people are exposed to radiation on purpose VERY seriously. And frankly, they should. There needs to be a definite trade-off between early breast cancer detection and any harm that might occur to patients, not just from radiation but from the stress of having to go through a biopsy when it turns out to be negative anyway. So let's say we were to start screening for something else. We would need to impose all the safety guidelines, regulations, and checks on that type of imaging as well. This is starting to happen for lung cancer, a few screening programs are already in place nationwide. Like for mammography, these have to be scrutinized to a ridiculous degree in order to be FDA (or state, in some cases) approved. This increases cost per scan, and also substantially increases throughput on CT machines. So to do it, you can't already be booked solid with emergency patients, inpatients and what have you. No problem, you say, let's not use radiation. Let's use MRI or ultrasound instead. Those don't emit (ionizing) radiation. MRI is most likely a straight-up no go. Depending on the equipment and the anatomy of interest, those exams might be 20-60 minutes each (mammograms and chest CTs take 5 or less). Most MRI scanners already have near-constant throughput, so adding hundreds more patients per week is not going to happen. As for ultrasound, since they can only penetrate into the body a few centimeters, it's difficult to examine large body parts with them. Plus, ultrasound is useless on air-filled structures like the lungs (air reflects ultrasound) and is problematic with water-filled structures like the bladder (which block ultrasound). So what would you screen with ultrasound, then? Pregnant mothers? Yep, we already do that. Those considerations aside, let's say we did screening anyway - a full body CT for everyone who wants one. That's a lot of radiation, for starters. Plus it'll take radiologists a long time to scrutinize hundreds of full body scans (radiologists are already accused of missing breast cancers because of the ridiculously high throughput needed when reviewing mammograms). And even if you find anything, there's a huge chance it'll just be benign. You end up worrying the patient, exposing them to a ton of radiation, and subjecting them to biopsies or even surgery for nothing. Independent CT clinics offering full body scans used to be commonplace, but aren't anymore, for precisely those reasons. The worst outcome of all would be a patient that actually had cancer, and then a scan missed it. They might develop symptoms later, and then ignore them, because the scan turned up negative, right? It's a false sense of security. Bottom line, it sounds like a good idea, but it's just not worth it. It's much better to restrict scans to people with risk factors and/or symptoms.", "Because there's no easy/quick/cheap way to do it. The sorts of machines that we have that can do full-body scans that would be able to catch a wide range of tumors are expensive to build/buy/operate, and already in high demand. It would cost a fortune to regularly scan everyone, when statistically only a very tiny percentage of 'normal' healthy people are likely to have tumors.", "There's no easy way to detect a tumor. MRI can do it, but you need to know where to look; just scanning your brain costs thousands of dollars, a full body MRI is prohibitively expensive except in the most extreme of cases. As well, with most forms of cancer, more obvious symptoms manifest themselves before the cancer becomes lethal. Skin cancer produces a distinctive rash, breast and testicular cancer create easily-felt lumps, bladder cancer leads causes blood in the urine, etc. The most common and deadly of cancers are among the most obvious, so simply paying attention to your own body and keeping an eye out for unusual changes is very nearly as good as a full body MRI.", "Well because lots of tumors can only be detected through x-rays and mri's, etc. But if you scan your body every year the radiation would slowly make you sick and ironically will damage your dna and rna which will then create defective cells that become cancer. Thats how the discoverers of x-ray's died, of cancer after their bodies became riddled with tumors. So the best we can do is tell people to be aware of their symptoms and obviously check your body for any strange lumps, etc. Us women are actually supposed to do a thorough breast examination every month on our own at home to check for lumps."]}

Most people have little exposure to real fighting, and up until the 60's, the only martial art they were likely to have seen was boxing. Movies followed these expectations, and most fights were stand up punching. With the rise of the Hong Kong movie industry, and martial arts stars like Bruce Lee, audience expectations changed. Stand up punching seemed slow and ponderous, so it was necessary to mix in some more sophisticated fighting. Also, the way audiences viewed their movie heros changed. You used to have John Wayne cowboy type leads, who were better than everyone else by virtue of being special. He won his fight because he was always stronger, tougher, and luckier than mere supporting roles, that all the reason the audience needed. Today's heroes are usually a little more nuanced. If they are going to win a fight against a bigger, stronger opponent, the movie has to show how he outsmarts or outskills the big lug.", "If you mean older western movies, it's because it's BAD choreography.

The last century has seen a lot of innovation in staged violence. Prior to the advent of film as a medium staged combat was only really used for theater, and the main type of serious violence that plays had been using for centuries was fencing. (pummeling someone would have been more slapstick, and likely would have just used an actual slapstick for the fight) This meant that the fight choreographers of the early to mid 1900's were educated in how to put together a sword fight, with any hand to hand combat as a bit of an afterthought. (there would also be firearms used, but that was more of an armorer's department, rather than a fight choreographer). In the 1900's brawling became the primary way to have physical violence outside of gunplay, as swords were no longer a modern weapon. Unfortunately we did not have the stage combat \"technology\" to choreograph these fights well. The blocking techniques used in film also did not lend themselves to good fight scenes. (the scene of shatner punching the alien: look at how close their heads are to one another, there is no room for a realistic punch) In film people's faces are generally closer than people naturally get to each other, so that they can both be in the same frame. With the advances in stage violence over the last 60ish years we now have some good western brawler choreography styles to use for knock-down drag-out fights, which also works well for simulating domestic violence, and we have a new generation of fight choreographers who can do a brawl as well as they can do a sword duel.", "In addition to kouhoutek's great answer, it's also related to technology. Specifically, old films have deteriorated, especially in terms of sound quality. Old films are often poorly rendered into video format for television, and as a result the \"sound design\" is much flatter and less effective than it would have been in a theatrical run of the original movie. Sound actually makes a huge impression on how you perceive action, and can even convince you to \"see\" things that aren't there (like, for example, a punch that would shatter a normal person's skull if it were real). Additionally, modern sound recording and production for films is light years more sophisticated, both in terms of equipment and in terms of technique, than it was in the 40's-70's.

If it's short, there's less possibilities for what is could be. If it's TOO short, then a hacker can just write a program that tries every single possible password until it stumbles across the right one on accident. This is called a \"brute force attack\".

(meaning if you spend $1000 in time/money/resources, when you get the password, you must be able to use the password to get more than $1000 back) otherwise its just not worth the effort. now just because a password is short or really long doesn't make it safer it requires a balance. a password like abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz may seem long complex and easy to remember but a dictionary attack would almost instantly crack this password ( dictionary attacks are common first step in password cracking ). and a password like A!B@C#D%, even though its so short it may be harder to crack than a longer password because it is not in a pre-built dictionary (i presume for argument sake), if it is not in the dictionary (most passwords aren't) then you must either try every possibility like (000,001,002,003,004,005) to eventually find the correct answer. or find another way of overcoming the password security.", "Every answer I've seen is correct, but maybe a little more complicated than you're looking for. Let's keep it simple and pretend you can only use the digits from 0 to 9 for your password: * If you only use one digit, your password only has 10 possible values: 0, 1, 2, ..., 9. * If you use two digits, your password has 100 possible values: 00, 01, 02, ..., 99. * If you use three digits, you get 1000 possible values: 000, 001, 002, ..., 999. * and so on. So each character in your password can have ten values, and every time you add another digit the number of possible combinations gets 10 times bigger. That's not a coincidence! Let's try it again, but using *only* lowercase letters and nothing else: * One letter gives you 26 possible values: a, b, c, ..., z. * Two letters gives you 26*26=676 possible values: aa, ab, ac, ..., zx, zy, zz. * Three letters bumps that up to 26\\*26\\*26=17,576 values: aaa, aab, aac, ..., zzx, zzy, zzz. * and so on. Now, if you're only using lowercase letters, an 8 digit password can have 208,827,064,576 possible different combinations. Does that sound like a lot? I wrote a little program that can count that high in 37 seconds on my laptop. To a computer - especially a whole bunch of computers working together - that's not very many combinations at all. But remember, adding a single letter makes it take 26 times longer! That would take 972 seconds on the same laptop. Another letter would take it 7 hours. Making it 11 letters long would take 7.6 days. 12 letters? 198 days. 13 letters would take 14 years. Bumping your password up to 16 letters would take my laptop 248,000 years, and AppleCare wouldn't even cover that. Whoa! Using 26 letters makes the time it takes to try all combinations get big a lot faster than if we're using only numbers. What if... we used uppercase letters, lowercase letters, the numbers from 0-9, and all the punctuation you can get by pressing shift and then all the numbers from 0-9? That would give each character in your password 72 possible combinations. If you made a password by picking 1 of those 72 at random, and you did that 8 times, it'd take my laptop 15 days to guess it. That's a lot better than the 37 seconds it would take if you only used lowercase letters. But hold onto your seat: if your password was 16 characters long, it would take my little laptop 29,691,578,198,499 **years** to guess it! That's over 2,000 times longer than the whole universe is old! So yeah, the time it takes to guess your password grows exponentially with its length. That's totally true.

I want to know your password, but you won't tell me what it is, so I have to guess. However, I have an advantage: I know, in advance, what are the elements of your password. In the above example, it's coloured cubes. I know you only have red, green and blue, so the amount of combinations is easily guessable. The more options you add, the hardest it gets to guess. This is because there are many possible combinations and orders you could use. Tech-heads call this \"high entropy\". It just means \"lots of possibilities\". In the real world, it's more complicated than that: * Passwords can have PLENTY of characters (at the very least, 52: all lowercase and uppercase letters), so from the start, you have a lot of possibilities to play with, even if your password is only 2 elements in length (still, easy to guess by a computer). * Passwords can be encrypted. This is just french for \"modified in a revertible way\". To decrypt (revert) your password, a spy would probably need to know how exactly it was encrypted in the first place, may require a key or know some secret you kept well hidden somewhere else. * Passwords don't have to be a single word or gibberish. You could use the chorus of your favourite song, a tongue twister, random words that sound funny together or some other easy thing to remember, but is really hard to guess. My main password is a 28 letter sentence to which I've added a few uppercases, some symbols and a few modifications (like writing \"bcz\" instead of \"because\"). It's pretty hard to guess. * Passwords are usually protected by a security guard. Unless stolen, this security guard will keep a strict protocol for anyone trying to guess your password: he won't let more than a few attempts, he'll stop anyone trying TOO fast, he'll let you know someone is failing too many times at guessing your password and ask you to change it, he'll become suspicious and ask the guesser some question to make sure it's a human and not a computer, etc. etc. So, by making your password long enough, you're making life so much harder to anyone trying to guess it it just becomes worthless to attempt to guess.", "The comments I've seen so far are wrong.

And I'm just a dude who stays at home and does this for fun. With 24 of my hash cracking machines, I could crack it in under a day.

If your password is 1 character long, and could be any of 94 possible characters. 2 characters = 94 * 94 or 94^2 = 8836 3 = 94^3 = 830584 So as you can see, the number of possibilities grow exponentially. This is why passwords often require at least 1 upper case, 1 lower, 1 number and 1 symbol, to increase the guess space. But length also matters. The length is determined by how powerful computers currently are. In 10 years when computers are even more powerful, 8 characters might not be enough, because at that point passwords can be guessed even faster. That being said, newer complicated security measures like custom salts per each user will hopefully remove the need for individual users to increase their password exponentially. It is also important to mention that this assumes a purely random password. Humans often base passwords off of real words reduces the guessing space.

No work is being done no energy is being taken from the system.

As said, they would emit electromagnetic waves constantly and end up falling into the core once their energy was radiated away; if they kept moving though, they would indeed be an actual ''perpetual movement machine'' (meaning they would basically generate energy from nothing). This problem arises because in most schools, you are taught to think of electrons as an actual particle (a classical concept), when in actuality they are quantummechanical objects i.e. excitations of their respective fields (probability \"waves\"/fuctions with partly \"particle-like\" properties so to speak). We can't measure their \"velocity\" and locality at the same time (or rather, the more precise you measure one, the less precise the other measurement gets), thus we assign them probabillities. We can calculate these probabilities and we find that they have a 0% chance of being in the atom's core, everywhere else however, that probability is not 0, even though it is infinitly small, on Venus for example, it may still be there. To get around that we calculate the arrea that has a 90%-99% chance of being and call them orbitals (basically what you get taught as the different \"shells\" of an atom in school (it's somewhat more complex than that, but that's *basically* it)). These orbitals are basically the \"room\" you speak of when refering to an atom minus the room taken up by the core (less that 0.1%). As such, \"electrons\" aren't really moving, but are *dislocated* in a large cloud of their probable positions around the atom's core. You can collapse this *cloud* into a single position by measuring them, but as stated above, you are unable to attain their \"velocity\" then.", "One reason is that electrons don't really orbit around the nucleus the way planets orbit around the sun. That's a convenient fiction that was once thought by physicists to be true, but hasn't been since around the beginning of the last century. I guess it is still taught in schools because the real theory is rather strange and hard to explain to an adolescent. It's hard to explain to an adult. One of the problems with the \"planetary model\" of atoms is that electrons are a charged particle. If they orbited around the nucleus like that, they would constantly be emitting electromagnetic radiation. They don't do that. So the model was clearly flawed. Along came the quantum mechanical model of the atom. It was realized that electrons in an atom don't occupy a particular position within the atom, they are more like a wave with a particular volume of space within the atom that they are *likely* to be found in. But that volume doesn't have a sharp boundary. An electron in your nose has a very very very very small chance of suddenly being on Mars. The electrons aren't static, so I guess you could call what they do \"perpetual motion\". They also aren't really in motion, though. They just might be here and might be there. It isn't really what people mean when they refer to a perpetual motion machine. **TL;DR** - Atoms are weird."]}

There are currently new reactor designs that could safely burn the waste from old reactors for decades and decades and designs that could burn fresh fuel much more safely.

And typically how much for a hit song?", "answer": ["Here was my experience: Every time my songs were played on the radio or on TV somewhere, I got a little bit of money - cents to dollars - depending on the use. One song was played enough times that it put me in a higher royalty bracket so I was paid more (1.5x the normal rate, I believe) per use. If played enough times, that money can really add up even if you're paid at the normal rate. I had a (brief) Top 40 Rock song in the mid 90s. To date, I've probably made $10,000 in performance royalties from it. Checks would come quarterly. At its peak, these checks used to be in the high hundreds to low thousands.

There are three in the US and one in every other country. They are ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC. I have included their websites at the end of this post if you want to go directly there to learn more. Basically, radio, tv, restaurants/bar, the web, etc. (Anywhere music is played AND money is made) must pay a fee to each of these companies. A songwriter can only be signed to one of these companies. They gather the money and distribute the royalties. Most songwriters are paid quarterly. They are generally paid three quarters behind so it can take some time to be paid for your songs. Also, songwriters need to register their songs in order to be paid. It is free to join SESAC if you meet with a rep. It is a very small fee ($50) or something close to that for ASCAP or BMI and can be done online. Also, it is hard to say for a #1 - depends on the genre But it will be substantial. Keep in mind, most songs are written by several people and those people often have publishers so it can be quite complicated and that number will be split and split again. You can learn more at  URL_1 ,  URL_2 , and  URL_0 . To answer the other question below. These companies either use their own in house monitoring service to see which and when songs are played. Or they may use Nielsen Soundscan which is pretty much the industry standard. There are also companies that monitor the internet and pay songwriters for plays they find online and then pay songwriters either on their own or through one of the performing right companies mentioned above. One is called TuneSat, but there are others too. Hope this helps!", "and also how do the people in charge of royalties know how much a radio station plays the song? I get it when there's stuff on the system as it can just link straight up online but when stations play records or CDs is there a way of counting plays?", "As someone whose rent is paid by this, here's my ELI5.. TL;DR: here are two types of strictly royalties as far as composers/writers go. Mechanicals and performance. If you're an artist or producer there's also artist royalties, producer royalties, and neighboring rights. Mechanicals: these are easy. The rate is set by the government and is paid on a per-sale basis at $0.091 per song sold, and that amount is divided up amongst the songwriters (so if there are two writers, each one of them gets $0.0455 for every song sold). They're collected and administered by either the record labels (who receive the gross money for the sale and pay everyone out) or in the case of cover songs, a company called the Harry Fox Agency. These payments are usually semiannual but sometimes quarterly. Performance: this is a much wider net. Is your song in a TV show? Every time it plays you'll receive SOME money - how much is up to a complex formula based system put in place by the \"Performance Rights Organizations\" (i.e. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, GMR, etc). I've made anywhere from 3 cents to over a thousand on a single TV play (depending on how long they use it, what time of day, how many people watch the show, what network, etc). Radio plays are also paid to the writers per play, and can be up to $15 per station per play. So if your song is getting 2000 spins a week (i.e. a hit song), that's $30k per week to split amongst the writers. Not bad. The PRO's all have different pay schedules, but to make things easy let's say they're basically quarterly. Streaming comes through both lanes depending on if you're published and how the song is released. Spotify/Pandora will usually come through the PRO (sometimes the former through the route of the mechanical). The rub with these services is that the music labels will license the song to them extra cheap in exchange for stock on the company or large non-specific advances that they don't have to pass along to the artists/writers - no bueno. Which is why artists/writers are complaining about streaming while the corporate side is suspiciously silent.. And lastly if you are the artist you'll get an additional artist royalty from the label once you've made back the money they spent on you (or making your album). Producers are entitled to a similar royalty, albeit much smaller. And then there's this thing called \"neighboring rights\" in other countries where the people who performed on the song (musicians, producers, artists) and the label owners get an additional performance royalty for that - but that is for another day.", "I worked for a radio station about a zillion years ago, when it was two turntables and a microphone, and we were required to keep track of what we played. With a pencil and a logbook. I assumed it was so the artist would get paid, but I don't know for sure. The DJ had a lot of discretion over what he played, so they couldn't rely upon a predetermined setlist. Or maybe they just wanted to make sure we weren't playing lousy music. But I think it was the royalty thing.", "Ok, I can provide a brief overview here but I'm sure lawyers and others more directly involved in the music business will have more to add and provide greater accuracy. With every recorded song there are two copyrights, one for the composer and one for the recording artist. Sometimes those rights belong to the same person, sometimes not. Anyway, composers and recording artists both have groups that represent them and collect royalties on their behalf. The problem is that there are multiple types of rights that can be licensed to a song or composition. For example, if you want to publicly perform a composition, you'll have to get with a performing rights organization (PRO) (or rather, the venue you perform at will). Want to burn your cover to a CD? You'll need a mechanical license but that's a different organization. You can see a flow chart of the process here:  URL_0  Bear in mind that the chart is based on the UK so some terms are slightly different though the principle, to my understanding, is largely the same. Theoretically, these various groups who hold all of these different rights pay the artists they represent, usually quarterly. How they determine the payment is usually by how much the songs they created are used. How that is determined varies from group to group. For example, record labels know pretty well exactly how many copies of a CD are sold or how many times a song is streamed on Spotify. But how many times a song is performed in a club? Well, that's a bit more difficult. To that end PROs rely on bars and restaurants to provide reporting forms on what they played. Few, in my experience, do, so it ends up being like Nielsen, where a small number of clubs are used to determine what clubs at large are playing. Like I said though, methods vary depending on the rights at issue. All of that being said, music licensing is a giant mess that leaves no one happy. This is one of the reasons it's a major topic for copyright reform in the U.S. over the next few years. I know it's not very ELI5, but hopefully it helps some. Edit: To answer the question about how long it goes on, it goes until the copyright in the work expires. So yes, the person will receive checks until their death and then their estate will continue to get such checks for quite a long period of time afterward.", "Fun fact: Simon Cowell's X Factor/ idol artists (one direction etc) almost all include musical samples played by Cowell (eg a single tambourine hit) on their records, so that Cowell personally receives PRS as a performer.

They get paid a shocking amount for this.", "There are two components of a song that are distinct and separate and understanding how they are different is essential. 1. The composition that a song writer composes and puts down in sheet music. This is the copyright and the royalty recipient is the songwriter. He is often represented by a Publisher. 2. A recording of such a composition. This is the master and the royalty recipient is the artist. He is often represented by a Label. The terminology is important. While \"artist\" seems like a fair way to describe someone who writes songs, it will cause confusion if you try to apply it that way in this kind of discussion. So songwriter-copyright-publisher and then artist-master-label is the way it is. Both the songwriter and the artist receive royalties but they are quite different in how they are calculated and handled. Sometimes the writer and the artist are the same person, probably more often they are not, but even if they are, they will get checks from two different entities. Think about \"singer songwriter\" as a genre, it's referring to someone who does both. Let's invent a writer and an artist for these examples - Joe Melody is a gifted songwriter and composer, and Bob Crooner is a singer with a killer voice. Joe Melody is represented by a Publisher, and Bob Crooner is represented by a Label. Each of those entities is responsible for tracking the usage of their intellectual property, gathering the income and distributing it to Joe and Bob. There are so many different revenue streams it's hard to break down who gets what from where but I'll try. I guess I will go by platform, and keep it simple. There is plenty of nuance and exception that will bog us down. CD, LP, Cassette or other physical format, and also digital permanent download: Crooner records an album of 10 of Melody's songs. His label gets him in a studio and manufactures a CD and gets it on Amazon and they also get the album on iTunes. On Crooner's behalf, his Label has requested from Melody's Publisher licenses to use the written songs. To keep it brief, these licenses are free and require only that Crooner notify Melody that it is happening. This license binds Crooner to pay Melody 9.1c for every sale he makes of him singing Melody's song. This rate is set by the government and the Label is responsible for paying it to the Publisher. The Label will administer this whole deal. So a track gets sold on iTunes. iTunes receives 0.99c and the Crooner's Label a month or two later gets their 0.70c. Crooner's label then owes Melody's Publisher 9.1c. So what happens to the other 0.60c and what does Crooner get? That depends. Because at first music could not be recorded and taken away to listen to again, we have a very well developed government mandated ruleset for compositions, but not for the master recordings. They were a relatively late development, and the free market has found its own level. Basically Crooner and the Label agree on a percentage of income that allows for both to earn something. Crooner agrees to a 15% royalty. Does that seem low? It's not really. Out of the 0.60c the Label is left with it needs to do a lot of things, including recoup the costs of the studio time, artwork, manufacturing, promotion etc. and also pay their rent and staff. The bargaining power of each party will ebb and flow over time and contracts will be renegotiated every couple of years. Three to five years is a normal range for a contract. If Crooner signs for 15% of net income on a three year contract and he really takes off as a singer, when the contract expires he can ask for more or shop around if he wants. Radio Play Crooner's song comes on the radio in your car. Crooner gets nothing. Melody's and his Publisher are members of a Performance Rights Organisation which arranges paid licenses with anybody who wishes to publicly play music and distributes fees to the songwriters based on how much airplay a song gets. This PRO will pay Melody his share direct and Melody's Publisher their share direct, this is not something the Publisher manages. How much it is depends on the PRO and what kind of deal they made with whoever is playing the music. Remember how I said Crooner gets nothing? That's just the way it is in the US right now. Luckily for Crooner, terrestrial radio is becoming a smaller piece of the pie. He will get performance royalties as an artist for digital radio and digital streaming services like Sirius, Pandora or Spotify. Melody is already set up to receive his songwriter royalty. For streaming it is set at 10% of net income, not 9.1c. A lot of streaming plays, especially if they are ad-supported might bring in a fraction of a cent. I'm going to stop here to see if I am getting at the info you want. I'm happy to expand and answer other questions. I've been in the business of operating label and publisher concerns for 15 years. ETA: the royalty cycle is either quarterly or half yearly and you can expect to get paid 45-90 days after the end of a period for any income processed during said period. e.g. Jan-Jun might be a pay period, and everyone would received checks mid August or end September.", "I actually do this for a living, in a few different projects: my band Canopy Climbers ( URL_0 ), my licensing projects Tiny Houses ( URL_1 ) and Monobox ( URL_2 ). Most all royalties are handled through my PRO (performing rights organization), and in my case that is SESAC. Most pay out quarterly via check or direct deposit, although I think SESAC can do monthly as well, at least for publishing royalties. Those royalties will keep coming as long as it continues being licensed, played on radio, etc. So essentially, you get paid for the entirety of the songs life. I can't speak to a hit song on radio, but I can speak to having songs placed on tv. These can range any where from $500-$25,000+, including both up front payment and backend royalties. Until we got management, we were licensing songs based on back-end royalties only, meaning no upfront payment, only the royalties received after the show airs. Now we get smaller front end payments as well as backend royalties (thanks management!). We've been placed several times on MTV, E! Network, Style Network, and then online in a buncha different places. How much the royalty is depends on several factors. Is is just an instrumental transition piece? Is it vocal-up, meaning a lead vocal singing in the placement? How long is it? The longer the placement, the more the royalty rate, as well as vocal up vs. no vocal. Also, the more the show airs, the more you are paid as it is paid per show. Would be glad to answer any other questions. Still kinda new at this but I'll do my best.", "I actually know this one! My stepfather was a recording artist. His royalty checks came monthly, they were small as he did not sell a lot of records in his later years. He passed away 6 years ago, now my mom gets them", "All the answers on here talking mostly about Performance Rights Organizations like ASCAP, BMI and SESAC, which take care of songs being played on the radio and live. However, if you're signed to a record label or a publishing company, and your songs are selling or people are covering your songs, you will be paid by the respective company. For example, if you sign to Big Cool Records, they'll give you an up front advance, some money to record the album, and they'll spend a bunch on marketing, etc. and manufacturing the album. Every time al album sells, based on how much royalty you negotiated with them (between 10-20%), money will be added to your account within the label. Once they recoup all the money they've spent on you (essentially making that advance you got a loan), you will be paid based on your royalty. Those checks come in once a quarter (4 times a year). If it's a hit song, you will recoup your account quicker and get paid sooner but that depends on how deep in debt you are with the label and how big the song is and how much it is selling (real sales - like on iTunes and in stores) Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions! Source: I'm a music lawyer", "I was in an indie band that toured a lot but never had a hit song (mostly college radio and specialty market radio), but which had music licensed for several TV shows and films, the highest profile of which was probably the TV show How I Met Your Mother. This was probably six years ago and I still receive quarterly checks on this. The checks have remained consistent mostly because the show continues to play on different channels internationally. The amounts have declined over time somewhat, but annually I would say royalties total about $3,000. However, I should note that I control both the writing \"side\" and the publishing \"side\" of our music. When you are paid royalties on music, the royalties are split between the writer(s) who are credited with composing the song and the publishers, who control use of the recording. It is common for bands to sell their publishing rights in exchange for up front money, or for record labels to control and/or own the publishing for bands they release. It would not be unusual for a song to have three to five \"writers\" and have the publishing controlled by a label or publishing company. In this case any individual band member would see a greatly reduced cut. Speaking from a musician standpoint, licensing is the best because you don't have to \"do anything\" and the money just comes in. Of course, they are few and far between, especially for a no-to-almost-no name band like mine was!", "Music royalties are fun - and slightly crazy. :) Quick credentials, I'm a director at a music licensing company that represents over 600 amazing artists. Here's a basic rundown. There are multiple \"royalties\" beyond just performance royalties, here's a description of each one: 1. Like mentioned below, there are organizations called PROs which are \"Performance Royalty Organizations\" - in the US that would be BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC. When a music artist creates a new song they register it with their PRO and that PRO collects royalties from radio stations, streaming sites/apps, and television plays from commercials or programming. That is \"performance royalties\" and usually are cents or partial cents per play - very low revenue. Which is why articles come out about artists being upset about Spotify and other streaming sites because they make so little compared to album sales. 2. Sync licensing is another portion of music royalties. When a commercial, YouTube video, Netflix show, or other content is created the filmmaker or production company must license the music that is going in the video content. This is a huge deal and allows musicians and bands to make significant revenue on the front end of content creation. Then when those films or videos go out they have time periods associated with the license that they can renew after 6 months or a year so for example the artist continues to make money as a tv commercial keeps running. 3. There is also mechanical licensing which is required if a music artist wants to cover and record a song that they did not write. So if I wanted to cover a Coldplay song and record it, then I would need to purchase a mechanical license. That way the original author gets revenue from that. One other note - it's important to understand the difference between the different types of ownership: 1. Master owner - a person who own part of the recording (think MP3, CD, the actual noise on a recording) 2. Publishing Owner - a person who owns part of the publishing 3. Writership Owner - a person who wrote the song Each of those owners get paid based on how much they own. Some people own 100% of their songs, while others might only own 50% of the publishing while their record label owns 100% of the master and 50% of the publishing. TL;DR: Yes, a song writer gets a payment each month from their representation like a PRO or their licensing representation which might be their label or a music licensing company. Feel free to ask questions. I tried to write this on my phone quickly, haha.", "**Can we extend this question to television?** My particular interest is in **how long** do royalties continue? Is [Robert Clary]( URL_0 ) still collecting from reruns of Hogan's Heroes? Is Carol Burnett still picking up a check from MeTV airing old episodes of her show? Going back to the early B & W 1960s, is Ron Howard still getting beer money from The Andy Griffith Show? If so, **how much** would you guess such 30-, 40- and even 50-year old shows earn for their stars?", "You mean a hit song now? Or a hit song when there was actually some money in the music business? Back then people actually paid for music, and even if you only had one or two good songs, a single hit could sell an entire album which would sell for about $12-15. There were big cuts being taken from that from the record company, reproduction costs etc, but the performance percentage earned artists something, and writers could still make money too. All of that is gone now. People don't buy CD's and most people get music for free on youtube. There are some legit services like spotify but the % is so low that you have to be a household name to make any decent money. Places like iTunes are a bit better but similar, and if you do get lucky enough to have a lot of people download your stuff, it is most likely just one or two songs - not a whole album. The reason most people don't care is because they still see people like Bieber in his Ferrari and assume pop stars are as rich as ever. But it's not true. The likes of Gaga and Bieber are not musicians or bands, but rather products that are sold with a huge company behind them. A company like that will put a million dollars down to promote a pop star like that, because they will get 50 million back. The problem is that all the smaller (real) artists and bands who used to maybe have a top 40 single in the past, do not make any way near enough money to survive anymore. In the past there was enough money in the business for bands like that to survive. Nowadays they make nothing from their music at all, and are in fact expected to just give it away for free because they need people to hear it and hear about the band. If you are lucky you will get people to buy tickets to your show and then you might make some money, although even then, many venues don't pay the performer at all unless they reach a certain threshold. tl-dr, big corporate machines like Rhianna and whatnot, are still making huge amounts of money. But everyone else makes nothing from music now. And for that reason, nobody is being signed, and in fact A & R departments don't even exist anymore. Nobody is out there visiting all the clubs and looking for the next big thing. Someone might pay some attention if you somehow go viral on youtube, but that is extremely rare.", "I am a songwriter. Here is your basic breakdown of how you would make money. Say I write a song that gets cut (recorded) by an Artist that is decently well known. The first I would need to do is register with BMI, ASCAP, SESAC, or one of the smaller ones. We will use BMI for an example. What they do is take a very small fee with the promise of going out and collecting the money you are owed from record labels, radio stations, etc. Yes, money does come in the mail and you get it roughly every quarter. If you are doing well you might get more. That's what we like to call \"mailbox money\". The amount of money you make on a \"hit\" song has a lot of variables. For instance if you are self published or have an admin deal then you are making 90-100% of your money on a song. If you have a co publishing deal you make 50% of your money and the publisher makes 50%. There's also writing splits. In places like LA where people are assholes their lawyers negotiate really rough splits. You can see 5 names on a song but what you may not know is one of those guys is only getting 2 1/2 %. This stuff happens literally everyday. Nashville is a more respectable place where generally who ever is in the song. Gets an equal share. EDIT: If anyone has any questions about anything or I missed anything let me know and I would be happy to answer.", "Back when the Dr. Demento Show was syndicated to about 50 radio stations one of my songs was played 3 times in a quarter. I eagerly awaited my ASCAP statement for that quarter and was confused when I got one that said that none of my songs had been played. Armed with a complete list of radio stations that carried the show and the playlist for the 3 shows in question I called them and asked what was going on. They said apparently none of the stations that carried the show had gotten sampled at that time and there was nothing they could do. So despite the fact that I could provide them with a list of radio stations, dates, and times to the minute when my songs were played I got no money. Remember that next time you hear about ASCAP suing a bar for playing music without an ASCAP license because they \"want to make sure their artists get paid.\" No, they don't. If they did they'd actually count the plays. We have computers, people. It's really not that hard. tl;dr: Me: \"150 spins on the radio!\" ASCAP: \"LOL NOPE!\"", "The composer gets paid by performance collection agencies like BMI and ASCAP, and by Harry Fox Agency, which collects mechanical royalties (sales of CDs LPs Tapes, etc.) For many years I received no check or $0.98. After I was performed more it began to average $100 a quarter. One time one of my tunes was used as a theme song for a network TV talk show for a week. I think I got about $2000 for that. I had one major hit. A famous rapper sampled one bar of a funk track that I had composed back in the '70s. in one 18 month period, I received about $150,000. It was one tune on a CD of 7 or 8 tunes. I as composer, got half of the royalties for that song, about 4 or 5 famous rappers, split the other half. Now 15 or 20 years later, I still get 15 or 20 cents a quarter for that song.

The composer receives what is referred to as the publishing royalty. This royalty is collected for the underlying written work or composition of a song. The second type of royalty is the artist royalty, which is collected for the exploitation of the master recording. These 'masters' are usually owned by record labels who share a percentage of their sales with their recording artists. To make the most money as a musician you need to both write and record your own music. Since you mention composer specifically, I'll address that issue. As a composer/songwriter, you'll collect on a quarterly basis from your publisher (i.e. Sony/ATV, Warner/Chappell, or UMPG). These publishers collect on your behalf for all exploitation of your works, whether that be CD sales/downloads, radio play, streaming, or sync licensing for use in TV/Film. Your publisher is all associated to PRO, who licenses and collects fees for the performance of your works from radio, concert halls, bars/restaurants, and pretty much any other public place where music may be played. The PRO will pay your publisher, who will then pass that money on to you. Publishers pay their composers on a quarterly basis and keep an administration fee. The more popular you works are, the more money you'll get paid. As for how much money a hit song can make, the sky is the limit. As a composer, you will collect more based on the share of the song that you wrote. Most songs are not written by a single person. With that said, the best way to make money is to get as many sync licenses as you can. TV and film producers are usually willing to pay a pretty penny for the right song in their movie, show or commercial. On the flip side, royalty rates for streaming are so low, you'll need to millions upon millions of views to start to make some decent coin. Mechanical royalties, which are publishing royalties for the sale of a CD or permanent download, have also declined substantially as music sales in the traditional sense are much lower than they used to be. I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have as I've been in this business for over 10 years.", "Well depends on what kind of royalty. Two types 1. Royalty from the publisher(songwriter's version of a label, most of the time paired up with labels or extensions of labels) These are paid bi-annually. You get 9.1 for every song you have on a album for each sale, unless you have a controlled composition clause, which means the performer of the song also had some writing of the song, which most of the time is less. 2. Performance rights organization. These are paid out every financial quarter, so end of March, June, September and December. There are two bigger public ones, BMI and ASCAP, and two private ones, which are invitation only which are SESAC and these brand new one I can't think of the name...These are the big money ones which know whenever your song is played on the radio you get paid. Depending on how popular it is on the radio it can be at a high tier than other, therefor a bigger payout. I have plenty of songwriter friends, and one, back in 1981 got his first check from BMI for 80k, and that's in 1980s dollars, and still gets enough payouts each month from them to pay a mortgage on a house he says, don't know how much that means to him, but probably at least a few thousand. Another friend, he's only like 24, but be wrote a song by a certain country duo, and in the first quarter it was a 210k payout, but was split with two other songwriters. His songwriting pay outs let him be able to jump start his own career which is pretty common. Brantley Gilbert who i don't really know, but we run in the same circles did the same thing, he wrote like a bunch of Jason Alden songs, which financed his own career before it really started, he also. This is also sometimes called \"passing down\" which a more popular country artist will have a single which a less popular artist wrote, to help them financially, and it's all part of the good ol boys club.", "When you write a song that you want to earn royalties from, you register the song with whatever Performing Rights Organization you are signed up with (ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC are the big ones in America but there are hundreds worldwide). When you register the song, you attribute 200% of the ownership. 100% for the \"writer's share\" and 100% for the \"publishing share.\" So, if you have an ideal set agreement with whoever is exploiting your music you own 100% of the writers share as well as 100% of the publishing share (however, many libraries take the publishing share and sometimes part of the writer's as well). If a piece of music is placed in a television show or movie, for example, it is listed on a cue sheet (a document that is submitted with every episode of every show and film detailing what song is used, who wrote it, who published it, and what kind of use it is - Background Instrumental, Background Vocal, etc.). This is sent to your PRO who keeps track of how many times an episode/film/commercial aired and other royalty-generating means, looks at the cue sheet and sees for how long your music played, and pays it accordingly. You get a check every quarter (3 months) directly from your PRO. This is a pretty rough break down of it but hopefully it is helpful for those unfamiliar. I mostly work with TV/Film music, but I think radio play works in a similar way.

My question is- do I need to be submitting my own releases to ASCAP or is it a label's responsibility?", "You probably won't see this but Courtney Love wrote a letter about 15 years ago about what piracy is. It explains how recording contracts work.  URL_0 ", "a bit late to the tale but here goes. there are or at least were a few different types of royalties back in the pre internet days. Radio stations would pay differing levels of royalties depending on the size of their audience. If you had a hit record on radio 1 (the uk national broadcaster broadcasting to millions) the payment, i believe, could be up to £45 per play. The collecting agency would take the payments from the radio station and take their cut which wasn't too much but lets say it was £5. The rest was passed to your publishing company who you signed your deal with (who should not only collect your money and pass on your cut but should actively try and place your music on to say tv, film, compilation albums etc). A typical publishing deal would be a 70/30 split in your favou, so they'd take £12 and pass on £28 to you. If there were four writers you'd get £7 each. It can get tricky though because there are royalties for the music and royalties for the lyrics. if you were to license your song to say an advert as my friend once did (a vodka advert for smirnoff, check out dylan rhymes - naked and ashamed) then there's two separate fees involved. The advert has to buy not only the music rights to use it (which are owned by the record company) but also the publishing rights. so they could pay the record co £10k of which you'd get a cut depending on your deal and the publishing co would get paid £10k and you'd get £7k as per the split. EVERY time that advert is played you would get a publishing royalty for it, depending on the audience size. there are also royalties for other things. If sheet music is produced of it then again you would get a royalty from that. Here's the interesting royalty which not many new about, mechanical royalties. these are paid to the producer (s) who may not necessarily be a part of the band. this royalty was paid for EACH AND EVERY physical copy that was made of a record or cd. I can't recall the amount, maybe 10%?, but it was worked out on the distributor price (which back in the day would have been circa £2.20 per 12\" record). It would have been collected in the UK by the MCPS, the mechanical copyright protection society. So there would have been 22p per copy in mechanical royalties. I believe the MCPS took 10% so lets say 2p. that leaves 20p and again, 70/30 split, the producer would come out with 14p. Now imagine that that album sold 10 million copies. you can see how that adds up very quickly to £1.4m. Just from one album. The producer probably didn't come up with any of the music creativity but would have crafted it all in to a song (ie, radio edits of 3m30s can be quite tricky to create from a full 5m30s song). Basically, the amount of money from royalties can be huge which is why Michael Jackson sold his Beatles publishing catalogue for $400m. Also, there was one occasion i recall that annie lennox had one of her songs played over 3000 times in one week on UK radio (details were published in Music Week). Publishing is HUGE. The guy who was Pink Floyds publisher owns/owned the Royal Berkshire Polo Club!! Hope this helps! EDIT: In the UK there is also a collecting agency called the PRS, the performance rights society. In theory, every time a song is played in a nightclub, the club should be making a playlist of what was played and pay out a royalty for each song. When people in the UK will see PRS stickers in shops etc, it's because music isn't free. If you want to have music in your shop to entertain your customers as they shop, you have to pay for it. again, you'd end up with a cut of that. I think nowadays shops get around it somehow by having their own instore radio stations. you'd also get a royalty if your song is used as telephone \"hold\" music. and as ring tones, and in birthday cards, fucking everywhere actually.", "Streaming and piracy have destroyed royalties though. My best friend wrote some #1 hits on Atlantic Records in the late 90s and very early 2000s. His royalties were roughly $500,000 usd a year. Around 2010 to now, between piracy and streaming his royalties have dropped to about $50,000 usd a year. Granted his songs aren't #1 anymore but he's been in this business for over 40 years and knows the trends very well and even years after a song is no longer a hit, your royalties don't drop 90 percent even a decade later. He's semi-retired because there's no more money in music so it's pointless to even do the work. People are just gonna steal it anyway. He did tell me though that what little work or writing he does is gear towards rock. He told me that among major labels that rock music is seen as a better choice than EDM or dance music because even though EDM is ridiculously popular at the moment, almost every EDM listener steals music. Stealing is much less common among rock music. So for example, if you write a EDM hit, you might have 1,000,000 listeners but almost every one of them will steal it instead of buying. It just seems to be the general behavior of EDM listeners. But if you write a rock hit, while rock is much less popular at the moment, you might only have 100,000 listeners but odds are very high that a huge portion of them will buy it. So you'll sell more songs to 100,000 rock fans than you will to 1,000,000 EDM fans. Hell, Steve Aoki and AVCII have been caught in their youtube vids using pirated software. I mean, they're filthy rich and can't even be assed to pay for the stuff they use...why would their listeners pay?", "I'm a media composer and write for a lot of trailers, commercials and tv shows. We usually get paid royalties every quarter (3 months). The amount is dependent on many variables, for example, the viewership, whether it's network or cable, time of day and what territory it's based in. However, some clients license your music through a \"buy-out,\" which allows them to just pay you a single (usually heftier) fee so they don't have to keep fulfilling royalty payments. I haven't written any \"hit songs\" but I've written music for quite large clients. I did an Ikea commercial about 5 years ago that still pay me every quarter. But for an example, I recently wrote music for a big kids animated movie trailer which screened on UK television for 2 weeks. I got approximately $8,000 for those two weeks of broadcasts so it **can** be a very lucrative business. (That's not including the fee I got to write the music.) I've written music for BBC shows and even shows like Kitchen Nightmares. BBC paid almost double in royalties beause it's network. The money is collected by your respective Rights Society, either PRS, ASCAP, BMI, etc. It's hard to wrangle in this business because fees, viewership figures and plays are all behind a curtain. You just have to trust your royalty society and their admin. Buyouts can be risky, too. I have a friend who had a client offer him 25K for a track for a beer commercial. My friend accepted without a second thought and a week later saw the commercial during the superbowl...he lost out on an insane amount of money because he accepted the buyout and didn't ask questions! That was a hard lesson that day...", "Finally, an excuse for my first post! I work for a European PRO (performing rights society) and from my experience, each pro collects license revenue from music users and distributes this revenue to the composers and publishers in the form of royalties. A PRO will license music usage in their own territory from radio stations, television broadcasters, live venues/festivals, restaurants, shops, businesses, record labels and also online platforms like YouTube, Spotify, iTunes and Amazon. Once a PRO receives the music reporting from these users, royalties are distributed to the composers and publishers based on a distribution schedule. The amount a composer/publisher gets is based on where the music is used and how large that license revenue is. For example, you will get paid more from a larger radio station per minute then from a smaller station which pays a smaller license fee. Once we have received the reporting for your music usage, a matching system will usually link this information to the song registrations we have on a database which are then linked to a composer or publishers account. Music usage in that PRO can usually take between 4-6 months to distribute but if your music gets broadcast overseas, it can take aslong as 2 years to receive this income from other performing right societies. I've probably missed out a load of useful info so let me know if you have a further questions!", "For actors, in the UK and Ireland at least, you used to get royalties after doing any TV or film. Now, you get a bit more money to buy you out of the royalties. My dad still gets royalties every year from a movie he did in the 70s. It was a small part. He'll usually get €0.50 if it's shown in South Africa or somewhere. He gets around €90.00 every year for a Christmas special he did in the 90s.

These are considered mid-engined cars. A car with 50/50 weight distribution front to back will be more stable, easier to control and faster through curves.", "Few cars had the engine in the back, primarily VW bugs. The original cars had them in front with a hand crank to start them.", "With modern cars, it has to do with weight distribution, the rear wheels get better traction when the most of the weight is over them. Back in the day, I'm pretty sure the main reason was to make the engine as close to the wheels as possible, to make everything simple and less likely to break", "The main reason is that the engine is probably the heaviest part of your car. Having it up front puts that weight over the two front wheels. These are important because they steer and do most of your breaking. For that they need traction. So having a lot of your weight on top of them keeps them on the road where they do the most good. Front wheel drive cars also use this force to stick to the ground while accellerating and rear wheel drive cars use it to counter balance the torque your rear wheels create with hard acceleration. Your front end actually wants to flip up if your engine is strong enough. Another point is that front engines are easier (cheaper) to cool because you have all that air you're driving through going against the front of your car. So no pipes or protrusions on the car. Just a nice simple grill with a radiator behind it. Rear engines in older cars are made mostly to be cheaper by not having a long drive train to your rear wheels. In sports cars and racing, the engine is placed so as to best balance the car for the race it's doing. Generally if you have your weight evenly on all four tires, your car races better.", "It should be considered that cars had engines in various places throughout history. I'm pretty sure the original Benz motor car was in the back, but that was probably to simplify the drive train. The model T, Model A, a whole host of WW1 era cars and trucks all had their engines in the front. The original Volks Wagen (which became the Beetle) had the engine in the rear because it made for a more compact, roomier interior, where the antiquated engine technology of the day could spew fumes and oil out the back instead of all over the passengers. As many have noted ad nauseum, you get much better weight balance if the engine is as close to the center of the wheelbase as possible, because it's the heaviest component. When it comes to designing a car, everything's about compromise. You can't make a monster truck take a corner at 70MPH, but you can't make a Ferrari climb over another car; you can't expect a Toyota Camry accelerate 0-60mph in 1.5 seconds, but you're not going to find a top fuel dragster that can go 100,000 miles and be frugal.", "The very early cars had rear engines and chain drive (1902 Oldsmobile, for example). Most of them used rear-drive, front-steer because it was more stable and simple. They started switching to front-engine, rear drive pretty quickly for several reasons. The drive shaft design was safer, sturdier, quieter than the chain drive. Liquid cooling needed a front mounted radiator. The more sophisticated transmissions needed more space. Maybe most importantly, front engines open up cargo space in the back. Some sports cars use a rear engine (behind the rear wheels, mostly just Porsche 911), or mid-engine (between the front and rear hubs) both to get the weight distribution closer to 50/50 and to reduce the polar moment of inertia. Having the engine close to the center of the car helps it rotate better."]}
{"example_id": 102, "context": "", "question": "What feminists mean when they say \"empower women\" and how \"empowering women\" will lower rape rates.", "answer": ["There are a number of stereotypes about sexuality in women in modern society, and many of them are problematic. The major one when it comes to rape, is that a woman’s value lies in her genitals, and that sex is an object or ‘treat’, that a woman can ‘give’ or ‘grant access to’. To say it as simply as possible (minding that it is more complex than this), if someone believes that they are ‘owed’ sex (whether it be because they have been dating someone for a while, because they are married, or even just because they were being flirted with), and they are sufficiently violent, frustrated or mentally unstable, they may try to ‘take’ the sex that was ‘owed to them’. The ‘empowerment’ idea comes from reinforcing the idea to women (and men) that women are not objects, or gate keepers to sex, but muti-dimensional **people**. Who have choice. And the choice to say no is one that they are entitled to. (Subnote: Not all rape occurs in a dark alleyway with a stranger. A lot of the time, it is someone known, or dating; where the woman is either too afraid/feels unable to say ‘no’, or the man does not listen to that ‘no’.)", "Firstly, a large proportion of rape/sexual assault is male on female. With that in mind, *feminist* is something of a misleading term. I am male, but also a feminist. I suspect most of my friends are 'feminists' without really realising it. Do you think that women fundamentally deserve less than men? If not, you're a 'feminist'. A lot of rape is predicated around the idea of power over someone else, and it is the case in some societies that men's perceived superiority over women makes it okay to discount their feelings. Some women actually believe this too, which is all the more surprising. By 'empowering women' to fight for gender equality, they send the message that rape is a heinous crime that men and women alike should scorn the perpetrators of.", "I can offer my female perspective which is more generally related to women's empowerment than rape. Education is the number one thing that would help women in countries with a poor record of women's rights and therefore higher rape / child marriage / abuse records. A woman who's had a chance to learn, to grow up without the role of wife and mother thrown at her before she's completed secondary school is a woman who is going to fight hard for her rights. If you look at the history of feminism you'll see educated women are treated better, have more choice and fight hard for their rights. Women who are married off young don't realise they may have other choices. Access to birth control. That's another huge step in empowering women. I cannot believe that there are still so many women being denied the basic right to choose if and when they should have children. In many societies women are still considered the primary child carers (which I think is bullshit, having been raised primarily by my dad) which means that when they become pregnant, usually at a young age, their whole life is fucked before its begun. Having a child is a choice you should make mutually with your partner, not something you have no say in. Religion seriously needs to rethink its stance in women. I'm an atheist but I have no issue with people who follow a religious faith. What I do have an issue with is people using arguments and writings than are thousands of years old as a template for his women should behave in this day and age. If we had left our medical practices the same we'd all be dying like flies but the mainly male religious leaders seem perfectly happy to ask women to stay in roles that were outdated a thousand years ago. Because they benefit from it. And the biggest thing for me is the right to speak out without fear of reprisal or hostility from authority figures. If women don't have a right to voice their abuse then society is failing them. This occurs even in western 'feminist' societies. Here in the UK there was a specialist rape case unit within the main police force. They have been investigated and officers fired for, among many things, flat out lying about cases being dropped by the victim, joking privately about women 'asking for it' and in one memorable case they pinned a rape victims underwear to their notice board because they thought they were sexy. Add this to the fact that most women are raped by someone they know and you have the fear of breaking families or friendships coupled with the fear that no one will believe you and a less than willing police force and its clear to see why so many women just don't report rape. TL:DR treat us like people, educate us, stop telling us god wants us to be second class citizens, give us the right to choose our pregnancies and for fucks sake, believe us when we report it.", "Uhh, well, an example would be India. There is an ongoing scandal in India where a woman was gang-raped, which really highlighted the rape culture in India. Essentially, the culture of India is *very* objectifying of women. Not in the \"video game characters have boobs\" way but in the way that women are *constantly* groped and harassed in public. Rape is a big problem because it happens a *lot* but the culture is very, very dismissive of it. They rush to blame the victim for wearing the wrong clothes, for being in the wrong place, and even the police discourage woman rape victims from pressing charges. The idea is that rape cultures contribute to rape, either from rapists thinking rape is \"okay\" or \"justified\" in certain circumstances, or rapists think something that *is* rape, isn't rape, or because at=large rapists aren't being arrested and convicted because nobody gives a shit, and because the women are too afraid to come out and say she was raped because that would bring shame on her family. The solution to this is to \"\"\"\"empower\"\"\"\" women. Instead of being viewed as objects for sexual gratification in a man-controlled world, women should be on parity with men. If women in India were equal to men and there weren't extremely restrictive gender roles, then maybe people would stop treating women like crap, and stop off-handedly dismissing rape. The reason I octuple-quotes \"empower\" is because you seem to have an issue with that word. Empower doesn't mean to give women *more* power than men. At least, that isn't its intent, even if some feminists go a bit overboard. My suggestion is to not get so hung up on words, and focus on the ideas.", "Empowering woman may lower rape rates or it may not - that also depends on the psychology of men who perpetrate those crimes. However, at least an \"empowered\" woman will have resources to whom she can get help and turn to for physical and psychological help when she gets help. And at least she will have the support to heal over the situation as quickly as possible. Edit -I consider myself a feminist. There are many ways woman need to empower other woman within our community, but in this example I just focused on empowering victims of rape to report crimes and get protection through the use of outside resources."]}

Even with no speech or text we still develop language. Just look at deaf people and sign language. Even if a deaf person isn't taught official sign language, they can invent their own if they're in a social group with other deaf people (or people communicating in the same fashion). BTW, deaf people think in sign language just as you and I usually think with spoken words. If you were to take an example like Genie, she basically grew up in isolation. No one in the family really spoke to her. It was very difficult to really \"study\" Genie (and also ethically grey) and it's also pretty morally wrong to repeat the same circumstances in an \"experiment\", but it seems like growing in isolation COULD stunt the brain. Humans may need social interaction to help link many of the other passages in the brain...this is just my personal musing. As said, it's pretty difficult to study such a thing. tl;dr Unless your hypothetical person grew up in complete isolation, which is abnormal, they would develop some sort of language.

We don't have an internal voice going on all the time. We think in concepts and language only comes up if we are thinking explicitly about it, such as when reading or writing. EDIT: typo", "I am going to disagree with /u/kparseyan. Obligatory mention here that I'm working towards a doctorate in English. You have to answer a question before you can even ask about this scenario: **what is language**? Obviously, written and spoken English/French/Chinese is a language. We all get that. But that doesn't really answer the question. We might also stipulate that, with no conscious thought (that we know of) plants don't speak a language. We can nail down both ends of the spectrum, but what you do with the middle is where the fun lives. What does language do? How does language work? Without getting super technical, language is a way of putting a symbol to a concept. The oldest adage about this is the word 'tree'. I say that word, you imagine a tree, but the tree you imagine might not be the same one in my head. We're not talking about a particular tree, we're talking about the concept of a tree. 'Tree' contains nothing. It is a symbol for a set of ideas. But even that's not enough. What language really does, its real power, comes in being able to differentiate between things. It's a relationship of various concepts, a network of ideas, that we separate out in taxonomies. What makes a tree a tree is that it is not a giraffe or a rock or a flower. What something is also implies what it isn't. The human brain, almost any brain, is capable of doing this. /u/kparseyan is incorrect when he says that, without language, you can understand sensations like hunger, pain, beauty....that's not true. Even if it isn't spoken or written, the brain has made a symbol for that sensation. There's an abstraction required, not to feel hunger, but to understand that the feeling is hunger and to act accordingly. Even without language, you'd be able to feel [gnawing hunger] and, probably by instinct alone, you'd be able to connect that feeling to satiation when you eat a sandwich. That's a language that is happening without words. That interaction relays a relationship between the feeling and the solution. That [hunger] is distinct from [sleepy] and [thirsty] and thus requires a different solution. When I feel [x] I identify it as distinct. Things can only be distinct things if I can tell they are different from other things. I need to be able to tell that hunger is different from thirst is different from pain is different from sleepy. Whether you put words or colors or pictures to those different sensations, you're creating a taxonomy of 'things' or 'concepts' that you identify as individual elements. Your brain, therefore, has a language with which to process those individual feelings. Even at the most basic level, you have to make the distinction of where you begin and the world ends. Seeing yourself an an individual, understanding that you are the 'I' is an an act of language. That written/spoken stuff is just a way for us to normalize symbols in social groups. It allows us to communicate our internal monologue with others. My ability to look at a tree and know it is different than a flower or a rock is happening by vision. My ability to talk to you about that time I fell out of a tree when I was six requires a set of symbols that you share with me, so I can relay abstract concepts reliably to another person.", "it's the other way around - what you're describing is self speak which is a result of of having learned language. Thoughts precede speech in terms of function! Language is a tool that allows us to contemplate complex thoughts though! Chomsky gave a nice talk about this in which he pondered the idea of there being a first human that could articulate speech and how it must have been for him. probably a very lonely experience. my guess is language evolved from sounds that evolved over time - we first had to develop the toolbox for it - and once it was there, it took time to build a vocabulary. it wasn't a single event - it was a phenomenon spread across our species. but this only one hypothesis (self domesticating ape hypothesis, which makes the most sense to me) - and there are many!

We have lots of evidence that if children aren't exposed to language in their first few years of life, they never develop anything like normal human mental facilities. Symptoms of such deprivation are almost indistinguishable from organic brain damage: poor sense of self, mental retardation, lack of sense of time or ability to distinguish past, present and future, etc. Of course, it depends on the individual, and just how much, or little, exposure to language they had in the critical period before 6 or 7. There is some evidence from children abandoned and raised by animals, although that's controversial because there are so few of them, and there is a question over whether they might have been abandoned because they were mentally retarded, or became mentally retarded because they were abandoned. There's also evidence from a few cases where parents have neglected their children to such a degree that they never learned to speak, but the same question applies there. Probably the strongest direct evidence comes from children born profoundly deaf. In less enlightened times, or less knowledgeable times, being born deaf almost certainly condemned the child to becoming a deaf-mute, and another term for being deaf and mute is \"deaf and dumb\" -- it is no coincidence that the word dumb is used for both stupid and unable to speak. In times gone past, profoundly deaf children simply didn't develop the same mental facilities as hearing children. Oliver Sacks describes a child, Joseph, who was born deaf but not diagnosed until he was four. With no attempt to teach the child any language at all, by 11 he suffered from a blank incomprehension, and lacked not just language but a sense of time. That was the fate of almost all children born deaf, until the 16th century when the Spanish monk Pedro Ponce de León taught the deaf son of a nobleman to read lips and speak. Prior to that, it was considered that those born deaf were hopeless cases. There's another data point. In the 1880s, European educators made an incredible blunder. They voted to prohibit the teaching of sign language, from fear that it would leave the deaf isolated from the rest of society, and force the deaf to learn to speak oral language. The result was a disaster for the deaf -- by the 1950s, educational outcomes for deaf children were so poor that educators were wondering whether there might be something to the old Medieval theories that deafness was a form of brain damage. Not just academic results, but poorly developed memory, infantile personality, and unfocused sense of self.

Language is merely a petty tool of communication made up by humans. Obviously animals aren't incapable of thinking or feeling despite being incapable of talking. Think of words as combinations of sounds/symbols that are commonly accepted to mean something in order to ease communication between people. So yeah, language is not the ultimate thought, it's actually pretty restricting, too. e.g. even now while writing that I stopped a few times to think of a way to write in words something that I otherwise have very clearly understood in my mind xD There are many things you can know and think but not tell or explain, like walking, or meditating. So yeah I hope I succeeded in communicating in words my thoughts to you ;)", "They'd be primitive. Their thoughts would be represented in terms of sensory inputs and biological imperatives, with no higher context. Their access to knowledge would be limited to whatever knowledge they could produce themselves, within their own lifetime. The cultural knowledge of generations that we take for granted, would be inaccessible to them. Think about how difficult it is to produce new knowledge, how slow the progress of science. How much knowledge does one person really contribute in one lifetime, even with access to other people, and the sum total of human knowledge on the internet? They contribute very little. Further, this hypothetical island person would be preoccupied with the task of subsistence living, with little time for deep thought or investigation. For further insight, you might ask how the evolution of the human brain correlates with the origins of language.", "Whenever people ask me this, I ask them to try and think of something, they usually come up with what you're experiencing - the thought in the form of language. Then I ask them to think the same thought (or another, doesn't matter) but cut themselves off in their head. You still know what you were going to think but you never expressed it through language in your mind. I think this is a bit of an interesting experience but like many others have said, language organizes and forms what you think. You're going to have different thoughts based on your ability to organize them through language. It would be the same sort of experience as cutting yourself off like you just did only simpler.", "As odd as this may sound, up until my late teens, I rarely thought in words or sentences unless it was remembering conversations, or preparing to talk to someone. The rest of my thoughts were images, feelings and music. When I'd see a movie scene where a character's thoughts were overlayed on the soundtrack, I'd think it was silly, because I assumed that nobody thought in complete sentences like that. Marrying a writer changed my perspective of that. I'm a visual artist, and my clearest thoughts are visual or musical.

Running the risk of oversimplifying things, I'd say that your hypothetical human-- assuming that he survives to adulthood and has reasonably human progress in his cognitive functions-- would have some sort of primitive visual \"language\". (Visual because, biologically, our brains our wired to favor visual stimuli over other senses). This language's basis would perhaps stem from memories of certain things that may be used to address particular needs. A brook would be something to sate his thirst, a cave for shelter, a stone would be something that can be used to crack open a nut, etc. His past experience of the world around him creates signifiers that can make sense of further experiences. If he once slipped on moss and sprained an ankle, then the next time he sees moss, he would take moss as a signifier of a slippery trail. On another note, there'd also be residues of baser animal instincts-- a wild animal hissing and baring its fangs, I imagine, would not need past experience as a prerequisite; it would probably immediately signify to our human, as it does to us, that he should stay away. I know this sounds as if our hypothetical human would not be much better, linguistically, than an animal, but again to run the risk of oversimplifying things, language (and the social advantages it creates) accelerates how we make sense of the world. Our hypothetical human could not be \"perfectly intelligent,\" because it's language that creates the conditions for (the conventional understanding of) intelligence. Having a word for moss, and having that word \"moss\" mean the same thing to a community of humans, means that members of the community would not need to encounter moss per se (meaning, would not need to have a past experience of moss,) to learn that it would be slippery. An older member of the community would just say \"don't step on moss, you'll slip.\"", "We may never know. This is a very interesting topic and be could learn a lot about how the brain works, but taking a child away from their mother and preventing them to learn any form of language is called 'the forbiden experiment'. But we do know that if a child doesn't learn language at a certain age, they might never learn any language and form some kind of mental retardation because some regions of the brain are underdeveloped. They think in a different way, they can make decisions and they can 'think', but they can't do it with the same complexity as a normal person can. We know this because some song birds have about the same brain plasticy as humans. They have to learn their song from their parents, but if we take them away from their parents they will never learn their song and their bodies will never fully devolop. MRI scans of the birds show that their brain is a complete mess. There is a lot of neural activity missing in these birds. Another example is of a girl named [Genie.] (  URL_0 ) A fairly well known story. However, we are not sure because her asshole father said he put her in that room because she was a little bit autistic. So we are not sure if her mental retardation is just from language depravity or if there might be some other factor at play. But we do know it didn't cure her autism. This is the closest we might ever come to do the forbiden experiment. Sadly, back in the day the only way to check someones brainactivity was by cutting open their skull and looking at it. if only they had the scanning technology we have today. We would know a lot more about the brain and how it works/develops. TL;DR: We might never know how they think because it is forbidden to stop a person of learning language. We do know from birds that the brain doesn't work as complex as normal birds.", "If I remember correctly from an old linguistics class - it was Noam Chomsky that first demonstrated that language is pre processed in the brain in a universal sense. That is, we don't think in language, we think in a more fundamental abstract way. This is hard for people to believe at first when all you've ever known is adding the layer of spoken language on top of that more fundamental process. So if you are Chinese, or British, or a remote Brazilian tribe; the underlying \"language\" for \"I am hungry\" is the same. It's the translational layer of spoken language that sits on top of that where the seeming differences lie. But underneath it's all the same. I'll bet there is a good analogy here for computer languages. A CPU understands instruction sets in a way that makes no sense to a human trying to read them. But if you put a translational layer of software code on top of the CPU layer then the language makes more sense. The instructions (thoughts) are still the same, but the layer of translation between them is different (C vs Perl et al). But I'm not and expert in this. This is just my memory from a class I took years ago.", "I think the top explanation is good but it can be made more clear. Language gives cause and effect some real scaffolding to attach itself to. When I say \"The boy hit the ball\", I know who hit what, what was hit, and what action took place connecting the who and the what. Language provides a way for us to keep track of not only those actions outside of our head, but our own thoughts within our head in a similar manner. It easier to think about deep, perplexing problems because we have the linguistic construct of the \"I\", \"me\" separate from the \"you\", \"her\", \"him\". Those without language certainly still have selves, but it is much harder for them to turn that into anything meaningful. It's not just that our conclusions would be less meaningful, or simpler it's that what problems and issues we are able to resolve are radically different without these linguistic constructs.

A chair is an idea, it is not the word \"chair.\" I've read often that deaf people and/or deaf+blind people will either think in signs, or think of ideas. I'm guessing it's similar to when you think of something, like an idea. If I say \"picture a red car,\" most people will form a picture of some car with some shade of red.

This is one of the reasons Dyslexics find language and reading difficult, because our brains are hardwired to think differently. Letters are each individual thoughts, and have a 3d diagram to match. Lower case b, d, p, and q all have the same diagram, so those letters are particularly tricky. It is completely possible to think exclusively in pictures, and like language in thoughts, it can help you to reach otherwise difficult conclusions and processes. For me, fully compensating for my dyslexia meant learning to use language for my thoughts comfortably, to use when convenient. Having both tools makes many concepts much easier to grasp.", "The short answer: Thoughts would be exactly the same as ours minus verbal behavior. The long answer involves going into how we think about language and conceptualize it. Language is under operant control, meaning it is influenced by the world around us. If there were no other people to talk to, there would be no purpose to functional communication. It would be very interesting though to see how one might adjust for this when it comes to issues such as keeping lists and reminders of things to do as well as for measuring. We store all our data/facts/list in a form of language so that other people could in theory comprehend it.", "This topic actually brings up an interesting topic in cognitive science. In order for one to learn language, there just be some underlying systems which enable for language to be learned! In other words, there is a logic decoding unit which is able to pattern match words and gestures when people communicate despite knowing know language at all. A language of thought.

Stephen Pinker (you should definitely read The Language Instinct) argues that all humans are born with an internal language that is not any of the world dialects.

{"example_id": 107, "context": "", "question": "How is 'planned-obsolescence' built into Smartphones?", "answer": ["Planned-obsolescence is largely a myth. I'm an engineer, and sure, we often design things to some minimum spec. It *could* be tougher, stronger, and last longer. For example, you *could* design a bridge to last over a hundred years. But a lot of bridges are torn down to widen roads, increase clearance, add a rail system, or other feature. And it's generally stupid to plan that far in the future. So, a typical bridge is designed to last 30 years. Anything longer is a bonus, and is desirable. And if you can spend an extra 10% and get several more years out of it, you might get approval to spend the money. But generally, you plan for a minimum, and don't waste money making it stronger than it needs to be. In devices, this means that a phone might be designed to last 2 years. Anything more is a bonus, and sometimes they *do* make them more future-proof. And it does make those phones more costly. But companies **do not** want to be known for having phones that die in 2 years. It reduces their brand value, and makes their customers angry. They don't do that on purpose, because it's bad for business, and people would stop buying their crappy phones. What actually happens is other tech passing up the hardware. Advances to Android/iOS, advances in cellphone radio technology, new software interfaces, increased bandwidth, higher resolutions, and other factors *besides* the phone.", "The most common example/complaint is the OS maintainers pushing out out an update that reduces the performance of the older handsets.

He found all of them had exhausts in good condition. When he got back to his factory he told the designers to make the exhaust worse.

I would disagree with he structural engineer who posted elsewhere in this thread stating that planned obsolescence is a myth. In my industry it is very real; everything from cars/fridges getting more complicated and digital- increasing rates of failure-to our disposable culture, which can be tied back to the 1940's, an early exam of this is disposable napkins and replacing reusable handkerchiefs, for example, but i digress. If you're interested, a great read on obsolescence in reference to technology and smartphones, which goes into a lot of the details it sounds like you're asking for, is a book called [High Tech Trash: Digital Devices, Hidden Toxics, and Human Health]( URL_0 ) - it talks about the manufacturing process as well as the lifecycle and recyclability of phones, etc (in the sense that there really is none right now; a lot of the rare minerals that go into making smart devices are bonded at such a small level that hey are incredibly hard to separate, and the phones themselves are not built to be salvageable). Other posters have also talked about the OS updates that cause complications with older phones. This is what we called perceived or valued obsolescence; the phone may work fine but it's value and quality are perceived to be lower- this goes hand in hand with the marketing narrative of \"newer-faster\" versions of the product to convince/push consumers to upgrade. (Sorry for errors, I'm on my phone!)", "Your question implies that planned obsolescence is companies *making* things fall apart/degrade after a certain amount of time. In fact, it's companies saying *they don't care* if something degrades after a certain amount of time. In smartphones, you can see this in a couple of ways: * Integrated batteries; even if you're nice to a battery, it will eventually stop taking enough of a charge to be useful. Batteries are picked so that most of the time the battery will not fail within the planned useful life. They save money by not using batteries that last beyond that planned life. * Software updates; as the OS and its core software advance in features and capabilities, it'll be harder and harder for older devices to \"keep up\". Every time the company releases a new device, their cost to test updates on every device goes up. They make up for this by reducing and eventually eliminating testing on the oldest devices. The older the device, generally the less testing it receives. This means old devices are more likely to have problems with newer software. * Wearing components; plugs/jacks, switches, and buttons are designed to survive \"typical use\" for a certain period. Things that wear out less-easily are more expensive. The company plans for the hardware to last past the point they consider the phone obsolete, and so such things often wear out not long after the point of obsolescence. The philosophy of planned obsolescence is really all about saving costs for the company by only spending what it takes to make a product last until it's considered obsolete by the company/majority of users. You can see that different companies approach this philosophy in different ways. E.g. my 2007 iPhone has been in continuous use and hasn't broken, even though it can't run a recent OS due to not being supported; but my inexpensive emergency flip phone died after about 2 years -- it was designed to be cheap and replaceable and the manufacturer *didn't care* about the phone surviving past the typical contract period.", "The only way planned obsolescence can work is if a company can keep a good reputation with customers even if the customers don't get what they pay for in terms of longevity. One of the only companies I know that does this is Apple, and even that is arguable.

In fact not even the best hackers in the world could figure this out, that's how impossible downgrading is. So people were stuck with a phone that was great 10 minutes ago, but was now slow as hell permanently with no hope whatsoever. They could either complain on internet forums, or buy a new iPhone. That's it. And it will happen again and again every year. You buy the iPhone and see that it's made of super strong glass, aluminum and sapphire - \"this thing should last many years\", you think, seeing how well it's built. But little do you know that while the hardware will indeed last long if you take care of it, it won't be able to keep up with all those software updates.

Sure... but how much bigger of a phone are you willing to carry and how much more are you willing to pay in order to get that more powerful battery? Or can they keep costs and size down by shooting for a battery that'll carry a an all-day charge for 3 years since they know customers typically upgrade sometime after a 2-year contract expires.

They can't even handle \"free\" healthcare to veterans- who make up a tiny part of the population. The \"right-wing\" standpoint is that the job of the government isn't to provide for the people. It's to safeguard people's rights to provide for themselves.", "Because it is not really free. The cost is passed on to taxpayers and republicans generally argue that leaving the government in charge of such tasks is inefficient and wasteful.", "Because it's NOT FREE! Doctors and healthcare workers still expect to be paid. Schools and hospitals still cost money to build and operate. When you say \"Free Healthcare\" or \"Free College\" you mean healthcare and college paid for through higher taxes. The folks paying the taxes don't like that all the time. Some of the time, it's accepted like k-12 school or emergency room healthcare. At some point there is a line where continuing to spend public money isn't popular enough.", "If you've ever been to the DMV, then you know the answer to this one. Every time you're there, you're subjected to long lines, convoluted regulation, and bad service. Why is it like that? Because there is nothing for the DMV to compete against. The government essentially created a monopoly that everyone had to use, and flooded the system by making it so centralized, leading to the long lines and inefficiency. If you hate the DMV, but need a license, there is nowhere else to go to, so you have to deal with it. Take this system into education and you see the same things. Book shortages, crowded classes, flawed standardized testing systems, under-qualified teachers, and substandard conditions. Take this system into healthcare and you see hospitals being overcrowded, leading to people waiting longer for vital services or having to resort to lower quality healthcare since there are not enough good doctors to go around, so the government will probably be hiring bad ones just like they hire bad teachers. The problem here is that you're paying so much through taxation for what is basically a shoddy product that could be produced better and cheaper if it were left up to a competitive market. Healthcare is already fully regulated even before obamacare, and all of it has been made unaffordable by the government. The one area where the government doesn't touch, the optometrist area, is the only area the average person can afford because it's legal for private doctors to bid prices down. If you're a public sector doctor, you have to serve these people at these prices, which makes it less desirable to be a doctor. A little known fact is that the most regulated businesses are healthcare and education, and they are completely unaffordable. The least regulated industry:technology. Computers are arguably just as complex of a field as biology, but one is affordable to the average person and one isn't. It has nothing to do with the complexity of the product, but how it's being economically handled. If you were to switch the political thinking here and say \"Computers should just be given to all\", you wouldn't own an iphone 5 for 200 bucks, you'd own a windows 95 desktop for 5000 if you could even get it.", "1 simple example: Because Americans don't want entry-level cars like a Toyota Corolla to cost 54,000 USD$, such as in Denmark, among other things. 'Free' is not 'free,' all of these programs come through VAT taxes and exorbitant luxury taxes. And the government is woefully incompetent, would you trust your life with them? There are many a story of U.K. hospitals so inefficient that it takes their ambulances 1 hour to reach a home 10 minutes from A & E. Sure, my premium might cost a pretty penny, but at least I actually have competent care.

They are paid by taxes, which are collected by government. Government is not very efficient in using money, so there is a lot of waste. On the other hand, the costs of healthcare and the costs of education are extremely high in the USA. Healthcare and Education in Europe are very, very good, equally good as in the USA. But the costs are much, much lower. For example, compare the costs of a doctor visit in the USA, with the cost of a doctor visit in Europe and you will find that a European doctor visit is much less expensive. Similarly compare the cost of a private school in Europe and a private school in the USA. Many times, a private school in Europe will be less expensive.", "I just want to add my two cents that this is a highly debatable topic, OP is worded in a way that presumes something is wrong with objecting to government provided health and education, both sides of the argument are being provided in the form of debate, and OP seems more interested in discussion than learning the other point of view.

Some of this can be extremely expensive to engineer and build, and on low-production models it's not practical. The bigger problem is the testing requirements: manufacturers are required to crash test cars and it's an extremely expensive process.

BMW had the same issue with their 745i Turbo. The grey market was successful enough that it ate significantly into the business of Mercedes-Benz of North America and their dealers.

It is not coincidental that these people you've seen are all Asian. It's quite common in East Asia for people to wear facial masks when out and about. It's mostly out of health concerns. For instance, in some places (e.g., China) people are very aware that the air quality is horrendous, so they wear masks as an inexpensive way to protect their lungs. Similarly, people are very sensitive to airborne germs in places like subways or buses where many people are crammed into a confined space. So many people in such situations wear masks to prevent themselves from getting sick or, if they're sick themselves, avoid spreading germs to others. Casually wearing facial masks in Asia is sort of the Asian equivalent of hand-washing in the West. Where westerners are much more cognizant of hand sanitation than dirty air, East Asians are much more cognizant of airborne pathogens and pollutants than dirty hands. So westerners wash their hands but never wear masks, while Asians wear masks but don't wash their hands (as often). *[And before anybody takes issue with that last point, I dare you to visit a public restroom in any East Asian country other than Japan - there is rarely ever hand soap, and when there is,  < 50% of people actually use it.]* Of course, everything I just said is an enormous generalization and there are obviously plenty of exceptions at the individual level.

The barycenter, the center of mass, between the moon and the earth lies inside the surface of the earth, but not at earth's center. So there's actually a wobble going on as the earth orbits the moon.

Synchronisation of data across multiple parallel lines at very high data rates is very difficult due to variable propagation speeds of those lines (due to variations in capacitance, inductance and resistance of those lines) 2. Increased cost due to increased complexity of the transmit-receive electronics and mechanical connectors and wiring. 3. Increased size of the connectors and cable, which is at odds with increased miniaturisation and available space on the connected devices. 4. Potentially increased noise due to cross-talk between the data lines, which can only be reduced by increasing (3) and hence (2). 5. Not all data transfers need to be at the maximum bandwidths possible with either serial or parallel connections, since both the data source and destination are likely to have other internal systems that have more limited bandwidth, such as a mechanical hard drive. So, why not stick with the smaller, cheaper serial solution? Back in my day as an electronic engineer, when RS-232 was standard, few could possibly have imagined the data rates that are achievable in serial connections today.

This energy comes in waves, just like you see in water at the beach, but the sun's waves move through the air. Some of the sun's waves you can see (light), but most of them you can't see. We call these by different names, depending on how fast they move. Some you may have heard of are radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays. Some of these waves you can even feel! When you feel warm sunshine on your skin, those are actually one type of wave. Lots of other things make these waves too. People can make these waves too, using special equipment, but we have to be very careful. The sun is the biggest thing that makes waves in our solar system. Different things stop different waves. A pillow or a blanket or your hand can stop most or all of the waves you can see that come out of a flashlight, but it can't stop the waves that you can feel - that's why a flightlight stil feels warm even when you can't see the light. The waves that come from EMPs and solar flares are extra hard to stop. They go so fast that they can go through a lot of things that would stop other waves. That's why doctors can use X-rays to see your bones. It's also why they're so dangerous - they can change how your body works at a very small level, and make you sick. They do the same thing to electronics like your TV and cell phone, but those get even sicker, and immediately stop working. The atmosphere mostly protects you and me from those waves, but electronics are extra sensitive. Because they're so expensive, people spend a lot of time and money thinking about how to protect them better.

All that matters is that the metal container is conductive and doesn't have gaps (ammo cans are bad at isolating from UHF on up because that rubber gasket only leaves the lid connected to the body at the ends, and that allows radiation in if the wavelength is short enough). If you're concerned about direct lightning hits, then having the can connected to ground could attract lightning to it, especially if it's much above ground level. I'd leave it ungrounded.  > The paint can sounds like a great solution for anything small enough to fit inside. Since it's designed to make an airtight seal, you know you have metal-to-metal contact all the way around the edge of the lid. Trash cans aren't very good on that point -- the lid probably only touches the can at a few points, leaving long (also thin, but it's the long part that matters) gaps, so RF can get inside. They, like the ammo cans, will still protect well from low frequencies (such as indirect lightning effects). Insulation on the inside isn't really necessary (the whole point of the Faraday cage is that currents only flow on the outside surface), but I suppose it can't hurt.  >  Radios are a fine way to test isolation. It's better if you can control the signal strengths involved and have some basis for comparisons, so you can get an idea of how much attenuation the can provides. The point about testing at high frequencies is valid -- in all but a very very few cases, low frequencies will always be better-isolated than high frequencies. The microwave, I think, is one of those few counterexamples -- it's a resonant cavity tuned to one specific frequency (2.45 GHz), and the edges of the door are positioned at natural zero-current areas for that frequency. At any other frequency, the fact that the door isn't electrically connected to the body around most of the edge allows some RF through.  > As for what frequencies matter for what sort of threats, it's time for numbers. Starting with the lowest, and therefore easiest for a Faraday cage to handle: * Solar flares and resulting geomagnetic storms: Hundredths of a Hz. Complete non-issue for anyone but the guys running the power grid and pipelines. Small risk of surges on the power lines themselves from transformer failures, but absolutely no RF risk (i.e. if it's not plugged in, it doesn't give a damn). * Lightning: Mostly below 1 MHz. That means wavelengths of hundreds of meters, so anything that more or less surrounds your electronics will protect from the electromagnetic waves (i.e. the indirect effects that extend hundreds of meters from the strike). Direct hits from the strike itself are nearly impossible to protect against, since a lightning strike can easily blow a hole through something like an ammo can. But those follow conductors, so don't store your Faraday-protected electronics next to that wire running to the old TV antenna on your chimney. For testing in this frequency range, try an AM radio tuned to the strongest station you can find. * Nuclear EMP: Worst below 100 MHz, but significant up to several hundred MHz. Wavelengths as short as several inches. This is where things become demanding. Gaps of several inches in length may allow RF to penetrate into a Faraday cage. Making sure the lid contacts the body around its whole circumference, or at least every inch or two, is important. To test isolation for this sort of thing, try at least UHF (FRS/GMRS radios operate around 460-470 MHz, which is a good example). * Non-nuclear EMP bomb: Up to several GHz, perhaps tens of GHz. Wavelengths down below an inch. Damn hard to shield against, but short-ranged and, in my opinion, not likely to be seen unless you're on the wrong end of a serious attack from a high-tech power. If you're still concerned about it, then look to absolutely, completely seal your Faraday cage. Consider soldering the lid on to that paint can. Testing at cellphone/wifi frequencies would be a start, but threats could go well beyond that frequency range. There just isn't much consumer hardware that uses frequencies this high. First off: The after-effects of solar flares abso-farking-lutely cannot damage anything that isn't connected to miles of metal. If it isn't plugged into the grid, and isn't a miles-long pipeline, and isn't outside the Earth's atmosphere, it doesn't freaking care. While removing batteries won't do much, removing antennas from radios is an excellent first step (having something that's designed to collect RF energy attached to your electronics is obviously a bad idea). Also, power lines can act as pretty effective antennas, particularly for VHF and lower frequencies, so removing that connection is also a beginning step. It's all a matter of degrees of protection, and something is better than nothing. I don't know exactly where you got [the idea that lead is the best EMP shielding], but I'm guessing you have nuclear EMPs confused with nuclear (i.e. ionizing, mainly gamma) radiation. They are very, very different things. Lead is popular for shielding from x-ray and gamma radiation because it's cheap and extremely dense, but there's nothing else particularly special about it. Its relatively low conductivity gives it a larger skin depth than other metals, which doesn't help for electromagnetic shielding. There are several things wrong with [the listed requirements of quarter-inch-thick-steel]. It sounds like you're talking about a low-altitude or surface nuclear burst. Those don't produce any significant EMP except deep within the kiss-your-ass-goodbye zone. Unless you're inside a hardened blast shelter, you'll be rather too smashed, scorched, and irradiated to notice that your radio isn't working. Widespread nuclear EMPs come from bursts extremely high in the atmosphere -- we're talking low-Earth-orbit altitudes here, hundreds of miles up. The effects are continent-wide, and they don't weaken very much with distance until you pass the burst's horizon. Non-nuclear EMP sources (lightning and conventional, engineered EMP bombs) are short-ranged, but generally on the scale of hundreds of feet to hundreds of yards, not several miles, so your guidelines don't really apply to those either. As for the shielding recommendations, those again sound like you're talking about gamma radiation. A quarter inch of anything is total overkill for RF shielding except at very low frequencies (tens of kHz, maybe?). Such low frequencies don't couple to small circuitry, so there's no reason to worry about them. In response to insistence that all shielding/cages must be grounded: The bit about grounding is simply wrong. Gauss's law does not care if your shielding is grounded, only that it forms a continuous, closed surface. If you don't know what Gauss's law is, or why it applies here, stop giving advice right now because you do not have the background to understand what you're talking about. I mostly agree about digital stuff being more vulnerable than analog. However, once again, lead is not special. Electromagnetic shielding is not a matter of absorbing energy, but reflecting it. Lead isn't uniquely good at either of those. You want conductivity and lots of it, but that's pretty easy to get from common sheet metals. The tough part is making sure that you don't have gaps with poor or nonexistent connections (like around the lid of a container, or at the door of a safe), so if you're choosing a metal you should go for something that makes good, reliable electrical contacts. Also, I'm pretty sure fire-resistant safes don't use lead in their construction. My personal contribution to the thread: HERO. Hazard of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordinance. HERO is defined as the threat to electrically and non-electrically fire ordinance and equipment from electromagnetic radiation. It's also one of the first things I learned about before the .mil let me within pissing distance of a blasting cap. Thing is, the military's been thinking about this EMP hoo-yah for quite sometime, and they are worried about both pulses, pulse weapons, and rapid accumulation, which has a tendency to fire ungrounded ordinance. So, to prevent electrically fire rockets and sensitive electronics from malfunctioning or \"cooking off\" due to HERO and EMP (which presents a HERO threat) the solution is simple. Mylar baggies, about .7mil thick, and sealed on all four sides. No grounding, no lead, nothing else. Mylar baggies. Shit works too. Next time you order a small electronic component from some internet company, look at the little baggie it comes in. Sealed mylar. That protected that chip from air travel at 35,000 feet, land travel through rural, urban, and suburban areas, and all the electromagnetic radiation that the trip entails. No ground wires. No lead shielding. No safes. Just what I've learned both from electronic warfare specialists, and from my own training in How Not To Get Myself Blown Up Or Fry The Radios.

Surveillance is a breach of our 4th amendment rights.

You are not the same person everywhere. When you talk to a potential employer you show a very different personality than when you party with your friends (I hope). Surveillance makes you retreat to a \"safe\" personality all the time. 3.) Selective enforcement of the law. You can scan the population for people you don't like and then scan those people for breaking of minor or rarely enforced laws and then suddenly enforce those on them only.

{"example_id": 129, "context": "", "question": "how does hypnosis work? Does a person who is easily hypnotized not have as much of a powerful brain as someone who isn't able to be hypnotized as easy or at all?", "answer": ["Hypnosis is largely misunderstood by a lot (perhaps even most) people. Even by the experts it is not fully understood. It involves taking a subject and working with them to open their mind to be more willing to accept and act on suggestions. I cannot speak to the psychology or physiology of that interaction--I'm not a doctor. However, I can say, from having listened to a number of stage hypnotists, that it is an entirely voluntary act. Hypnosis is not about the hypnotist taking control of a weak mind. It's about the hypnotist guiding a person to bring their mind to a very specific state. Thus, according to some hypnotists, it is actually *easier* to hypnotize \"smart\" people (I will leave the defining of \"smart\" as an exercise for the reader; most likely the key characteristic is that the individual has a good awareness, an ability to follow instructions, and an ability to \"let go.\"). It's also important to remember that a person under hypnosis still has quite a lot of voluntary control. They cannot be made to go against their moral fiber or to ignore most basic instincts (\"you can't hypnotize someone to death\"). Also (for fans of the movie Office Space) if someone is put into hypnosis and then the hypnotist leaves then they will come out of hypnosis relatively quickly (as in within hours, as opposed to being in a semi-trance for the rest of their life). Hypnotic triggers can be activated decades later, though (in some cases).", "As a non-official expert on hypnosis ^^^and ^^^by ^^^that ^^^I ^^^mean ^^^a ^^^hypnofetishist REAL hypnosis is not at all like you might see in movies or stage(d) hypnosis. It has nothing to do with someone's intelligence or mental power or whatever. It does not grant complete control over someone. It cannot make you do anything you already are not willing to do. Hypnosis basically allows you to relax and become \"suggestable\". That doesn't mean \"Will obey any suggestion\", it means that, when a suggestion is made by the hypnotist, your brain will consider the possibility of taking that action, as opposed to your normal inhibitions taking over and, for example, saying \"But that's embarassing!\". In the same sense, if someone were to hypnotize you and suggest that you do something that you would never in a million years do... you won't do it. That will usually cause you to snap out of trance, but even if you don't, you won't feel compelled to do something you absolutely would never do in the first place. So, if you're told to think you're a chicken, and you start clucking, you probably don't care if it makes you look a little silly, especially since stage hypnosis has a sort of \"magic show\" feel and you're more inclined to accept silly commands. But if someone were to, for example, hypnotize you and tell you to have sex with them, unless you REALLY wanted to screw that person, you wouldn't do it.", "Hypnotist here (on a hobby basis). **First question:** There are many theories to how it works, but the one I was taught is that your brain has a filter called the \"critical filter/sense/mind\". Hypnosis is ONE way to lower the critical filter to a point where commands are accepted without question. The \"concious mind\" is considered to contain this filter, so the general goal in hypnosis is to get you unconcious (not in the sense of being knocked out) but still listening. The most widely spread way of doing this is to put someone to sleep. Almost. That's why hypnotists say \"Sleep!\", because we're all familiar with that state and it helps to lower/disable the critical filter. **Second question:** \"Powerful\" is a provocative word. It's not that they are not as powerful, it's that some people will respond better to authority than others. In classical hypnosis (aka \"direct\" aka. \"You are getting tired! You are sleepy!\") you are relying a lot on that people will accept your authority without question. In modern hypnosis (aka. \"indirect\" aka. \"You MAY feel your eyes are getting HEAVY\") you don't rely on authority as much so it will work on more people. Your language is the key. (Third question - you didn't ask, but you assumed something about hypnosis): Please understand that a good hypnotist can hypnotize anyone. Both \"Powerful\" or not. Some people make *easier* clients because they accept authority better but a good hypnotist can hypnotize anyone IF they are WILLING. **Some more info on the two methods:** Classic: Forcing your will onto someone until they \"caved in\" either by having them look at a fixed point or repeating commands like \"Sleep! Your eyes are getting tired!\" etc. This is how hollywood usually depicts it. It can look and sound dramatic so it makes for good theater and movies. **Modern:** Use of indirect commands like \"You may feel your eyes are getting heavier, so it's ok to blink and close them\" or \"As you sit in the chair and feel the weight of your own body dragging you down you may feel a relaxing sensation. It's ok to go along with it\". This is not so dramatic, however this is the way most modern therapeutic hypnosis works. You can combine the methods since the classic method can be more effective and less time consuming. **Are there other methods than classic and modern?** Yes! There are a lot of \"instant-\" and \"almost-instant\" methods that work on the same principle as trick-theifes use: Confusion. Confusion means your brain is desperately looking for an explaination and will likely grab at whatever it gets. This is where you have a split second to throw in a command like \"Sleep!\". You can also use physical touch, turn people around, grab their hand and even bump directly into them to get a moment of confusion. In this moment, your attention will be misdirected and/or looking for explaination or direction. The idea is that you forcibly tell them to sleep in the moment of confusion to give them direction. It won't always work. People are different. **\"Fun\" fact about confusion and misdirection (act of directing your concious attention):** Trick-thieves use this method as they bump into you (initial confusion), then they grab you with both arms (extends confusion) and say sorry (explaination and misdirection) and perhaps grab your arm (confusion and misdirection) and shake your hand (extends confusion) to \"truly\" say sorry (misdirection) and perhaps even go further to ask for direction while talking quickly and saying contradictory things (further extending the confusion and misdirection). Meanwhile, his hands are all over your wallet but you won't conciously notice because your constantly confused and misdirected. Long write. I hope this helped someone. Let me know if you need any further explaination.", "Your susceptibility to hypnosis depends on your ability to bypass your \"critical factor,\" not on your intelligence. So what is the critical factor? Every day, you have random thoughts, such as \"I really hope I don't spill this cup of apple juice all over myself.\" Or \"I should go study now.\" Whether your subconscious mind automatically carries out these instructions depends on your critical factor. When you are child, you have not yet developed the critical factor. That's why if you tell a small child: \"don't drop that,\" they will invariably drop whatever they are holding (since the subconscious mind can't understand \"don't\" - e.g. if you read \"don't picture a pink elephant,\" you tend to automatically picture a pink elephant). It's because they have no critical factor. The instructions you give them go directly to their subconscious mind, and and their body implements them. As you grow older, you recognize that you can't simply blindly follow every external instruction that you receive. However, you still need the ability to communicate with your subconscious. How else do you instruct your body to do things, like eat, drink, walk over to the bed, etc? Your critical factor parses which instructions you want to follow and which you do not. A hypnosis \"induction,\" which is said before any instructions are attempted, is supposed to induce the subject into a relaxed state and to distract the conscious mind so that the critical factor will be lessened (for the later instructions to come). For 99% of the population, hypnosis places them in a relaxed state where their critical factor is not as strong. These people are more likely to follow suggestions. But for those 99%, when they are hypnotized, they still feel in complete control. If they are hypnotized by a stage hypnotist, for example, to squack like a chicken, they will report that they were aware of what was happening the whole time. They complied because they thought it would be funny and didn't see any harm in it. The hypnosis induction made them relaxed and lessened their critical factor, so they were less worried in this state about embarrassment or the social implications of doing something stupid. The fact that everyone expected them to comply also lessened the social embarrassment from doing something stupid and in fact placed peer pressure to comply. So most people under hypnosis are still in complete control of themselves. They are simply in a state of heightened suggestiveness. However, one could choose not to be hypnotized. The induction won't do anything to you if you think hypnosis is stupid or won't work (this is your critical factor telling you not to pay any attention to the hypnosis). I have personally been under hypnosis and gotten an important phone call and decided to break out of the trance state and go back to my \"normal\" state so I could answer the phone. There is no such thing for most people that if they are not broken out of trance, they will continue to walk around like zombies. For most people, also, unless they are completely skeptical of hypnosis, the longer you spend on the induction (relaxing their critical factor), the more susceptible they will later be to suggestions. So for 99% of the population, hypnosis is not strong enough to alter your perception of reality or force you to do anything you would not otherwise. However, approximately 1% of the population are extremely susceptible to hypnosis. They can be hypnotized to *completely eliminate* their critical factor. They will accept all suggestions with critically evaluating them, just as a small child might. The hypnotist is giving commands directly to their subconscious, with no interruption for their conscious mind. These can be hypnotized not to feel pain. They can be age regressed so they can perfectly describe a memory from when they were 2 years old and can be led to believe they are actually still 2 years old. They can be hypnotized to forget whatever they have done while under hypnosis. There are various measures of susceptibility to hypnosis, such as the Harvard Group Scale (HGSS). Hypnosis works better to treat some types of disorders because they tend to be more susceptible. For example, people with multiple dissociative personality disorders tend to be VERY susceptible to hypnosis and can be hypnotized to switch between various personalities to allow the therapist to talk to a certain personality. Here are some examples of what can be done to this hyper-sensitive 1% with hypnosis. They can be convinced to throw what they believe to be acid in someone's face:  URL_2  They can be hypnotized not to feel extreme cold (to the point where they could die of hypothermia without ever feeling cold):  URL_0  They can be instructed to forget what has happened (Derren has already hypnotized this subject at this point in the video not to remember anything he does when he sees polka dots):  URL_3  Disclaimer - Derren is an entertainer, but what he does in selecting a subject (narrow down to only the most susceptible person he could find) is done by many other researchers who have tested hypnosis theories. You can also see Derren himself being *shocked* at certain points in the video that his subject really doesn't seem to remember anything. Derren himself is amazed at how far he can go with hypnosis with someone who is so hyper-sensitive to it, which leads to the conclusion that these videos are not merely staged for entertainment purposes. Derren even makes the subject take a polygraph to see if he is lying about being that deep in trance:  URL_1 ", "As far as I know you have to 'accept' the hypnosis. You're not meant resist it because the reason why you are being hypnotized is likely to get help i.e. hypnosis as a cure for irrational arachnaphobia.", "I have notes related to this topic so let me just post it here: **What is hypnosis?** It is the ability, using verbal direction, to lead someone into an altered state of consciousness (it resembles daydreaming), during which time they are much more receptive to suggestion. Once in this state, the hypnotist can make either direct or indirect suggestions to help the subject to break damaging or undesirable habits, such as smoking, over eating, anxiety, etc. This is where hypnosis becomes hypnotherapy. The actual mechanism that makes hypnosis work is quite difficult to quantify. Basically, the things that drive us and make us who we are, are deeply embedded in our subconscious mind. We don’t need to carefully think about what we strongly agree or disagree with, what we love or hate, or strongly desire, it is “hard wired” into our mind. Some of this comes from personal experience, preference, and needs, and some from our childhood from direct commands or suggestions from our parents or authority figures. Normally we process information via our 5 senses and our “hard wiring” forms something termed the “critical censor,” which acts as a kind of filter to determine whether anything presented to us conforms with our deepest beliefs. The critical censor decides whether or not to accept or reject the information presented to us. If it is accepted it is “absorbed” into our subconscious and becomes either accepted knowledge, a part of our belief system, a moral viewpoint, or an ambition/desire. Information or commands that are at odds with our previously accepted knowledge, beliefs, morals, or desires are rejected by the critical monitor, and they have no effect on our behaviour or actions. This can be explained quite nicely by Freudian psychology. The Id (subconscious) is the most powerful part of the mind, and it automatically, and without our conscious realisation, contains our deepest desires, and controls our behaviour. The Ego (rational, logical mind) analyses information to see if it makes sense, before passing it onto the Super Ego (critical censor). The Super Ego is like the gatekeeper to the subconscious mind, it decides whether or not to accept the information, instruction, command, and either sends it into the Id (subconscious) where it becomes a component of our behaviour, or rejects it out of hand. All problem behaviour, like smoking for example, are habits that are embedded in our subconscious mind and have become a part of our image of who we are, this is why they are difficult to break. We all know that smoking is bad for our health, but trying to make yourself stop is incredibly difficult – the command that your logical mind gives yourself is rejected by the critical censor and never makes it into the subconscious. This is where hypnosis can help. By concentrating all of the subjects attention onto a single object, their critical censor is gradually subdued allowing the hypnotist to speak almost directly to the subconscious mind, and overcoming the problem of the suggestion not being accepted. **Common Misconceptions about hypnosis** *1) You can be hypnotized and do things against your will* The simple fact is that although you subdue the critical censor and speak almost directly to the subconscious mind, people will not respond to suggestions that are against their most deeply held moral beliefs. *2) Under hypnosis you are unconscious* This is not the case. Hypnosis is an altered state of mind in which the subject is in a state similar to daydreaming. They are at all times conscious and aware and in control of what is happening to them, and can come out of hypnosis anytime that they choose. *3) Only weak minded people can be hypnotized* The opposite is true. Generally more intelligent people are easier to hypnotise, possibly because they have a greater ability to inwardly visualise and not be distracted by other thoughts. *4) You can get stuck in Hypnosis* This is impossible, if the hypnotist dropped dead after inducing the trancethe subject would either come out of hypnosis by themselves or drift off to sleep. *5) You can be made to reveal embarrassing secrets* This is false for the reasons given above. The subject is aware of what is happening and can not be forced to do things against their will. *6) If you can hear the Hypnotist you weren’t hypnotised* People experience hypnosis in different ways. Hearing and remembering what the hypnotist said to you is completely natural, hypnosis is not sleep, it is an altered state of consciousness. Although your subject may not have felt hypnotised, the hypnotist can usually visually see the physical changes, and of course the subjects modified behaviour is the ultimate proof.", "Hypnotherapist here (registered with the GHSC in the UK) and I also just graduated with my BSc in Psychology. Hypnosis is a deeply relaxed state of focused attention (e.g. The hypnotises voice). All hypnosis is self hypnosis, you are always the one who puts yourself in trance. I prefer to call a hypnotherapist a 'hypnotic operator'. For the sake of ELI5, hypnosis allows you to relax your conscious, thinking part of your mind and explore the realms of your unconscious which, when coupled with suggestions, can create powerful change. Hypnotisability is correlated to intelligence but int he opposite way you describe. People below a certain IQ (iirc 75?) cannot be/very hard to be hypnotised as an imagination must be present. The more creative you are, the more easily you can be hypnotised. Those who are more SKEPTICAL however have a harder time of letting go. While this may scream the placebo effect, there have been hundreds of clinical studies comparing the effects of hypnosis to a placebo, meditation and suggestions without trance. Hypnosis is almost always show to be better than the alternatives (the studies I recall were using hypnosis for both chronic and acute pain relief).

It's the conclusions that might not be valid. If you find that 'random people' meant, the local rain demon cult, you might question whether that's a fair sample. You might decide to perform a *similar* experiment, but fundamentally different by asking 30 people chosen at random from the phone book instead. You might also question whether asking people where the rain comes from is a valid way to actually determine where the rain comes from. You might think the experiment should not be used to come to that conclusion. But if you feel that my results were faithfully recorded, the experiment still has merit. Maybe you want to know how many people in rain demon cults report that rain comes from the rain demon, for example. But if the method and results are re order faithfully and detailed, the experiment will always have some merit. It just depends on what kind of merit exactly."]}

The thing is, as the language changed over time, it grew to not include very much palatalization (whereas some languages like French and Russian have quite a bit), so it became awkward or, at least not common place, for many native speakers to palatize their vowels in these positions. However, right near this palatal space is the fricative space where we pronounce fricative consonants (e.g., sounds like \"sh\" in \"shoot\" and \"zh\" in the second \"g\" of \"garage\"). This fricative space is directly behind where your top and bottom teeth meet. So people with difficulty making this sound would drop their tongues slightly and go from having the vowel be palatal to the consonant preceding the vowel be fricative. To make a long story short, this change is part of a common phenomenon where the pronunciation is assimilated into already familiar sounds.

Motorcycles however are single track vehicles that turn differently than cars. On a car you turn the wheels and they shift left or right.

Also front wheel drive causes things to be bad at turning. A FWD car will always understeer, not an admirable trait for a bike. Higher end cars often are equipped with rear wheel drive or all wheel drive which both offer advantages in performance over front wheel drive however are less economic.", "it's engineering reasons. cars come in all kinds of drivetrain. it's just that most are front wheel drive, because they're cheap, efficient, light, and mostly controllable. on a bike. it's easier to transfer the power to the rear wheel, as they don't really lose and efficiency by doing so, unlike most rear wheel drive car, which have to add a number of moving parts, and along with it, weight, to transfer the power from the front of the car, all the way to the rear (quite a bit more part than you might think) so on a bike, there's no real reason to move the driving wheel. instead, there reason to keep it rear wheel driven. that is weight bearing and grip. on acceleration, weight transfer occurs, and some amount of weight is transferred to the rear half of the vehicle, and then to the rear wheel, and now because it's bearing more load, it's being pushed down, and it has more grip, so more acceleration, means more weight transfer means more grip, at least until the tire hit it's limit but if it were front wheel driven, when you accelerate, the weight that was supposed to be pushing down on the driving wheel, the front wheel, and lifted off, and so the more you accelerate, the less grip it has. on a car, it may just results in wheel spin, but that's it, reduce the acceleration, the tires grip again, and you're off again. but a loss of front wheel grip on a bike is literally fatal. because you're balancing your bike with your body, and not with 4 wheels, once one of your wheel loses grip, it's SUPER easy to lose balance and fall. rear wheel momentary loss of grip may still be manageable, but front wheel loss of grip will almost guarantee you a fall. of course there's mechanical reasons too, mainly how to transfer the power to the front wheel on a bike, except is it's an electric bike TL;DR : you want grip on the driving wheel, and when you accelerate you're 'giving' the rear wheel more grip. but loss of grip on the front wheel on a bike is more fatal than it is on a car", "Most cars have engines in the front. The engine is pointed sideways so that the turning motion the engine generates can be connected straight to one of the front wheels. If the engine needs to turn one of the back wheels, then you need to add a bunch of stuff in order to get the turning motion from the engine all the way to a back wheel. This usually means a long shaft connected at 90 degrees to another shaft that is connected to the wheels. The more stuff you add the more you lose energy to friction. This is bad for fuel economy.", "The only reason FWD exists is because of packaging and cost. FWD is cheap to produce as everything interesting about the car (engine, driven wheels) can be packaged together in one place. RWD provides superior handling and performance to FWD. It permits you to have control over the behavior of both the front and rear of the vehicle under acceleration and braking (e.g. oversteer), allows 100% of friction from one set of wheels to be allotted to acceleration instead of split between steering and acceleration, and due to weight transfer under acceleration allows for greater force to be applied while accelerating (weight shifts to the rear when accelerating and shifts to the front when braking, thus large brakes on the front wheels). There is also no interference of the powertrain with the steering of a RWD vehicle -- e.g. torque steer can occur in a FWD car if one wheel gains even slightly more traction than the other -- and the feeling/responsiveness of the steering wheel is usually better because of the lack of interference as well. AWD in performance cars is usually heavily biased to send power to the rear wheels, and it's for these reasons. The reason AWD is useful in performance cars is because many of them have so much power that the rear wheels alone do not have enough traction to put all of that power to the road without wheelspin, so the front wheels can also be used for acceleration. AWD drivetrains have more loss due to mechanical inefficiencies, so there needs to be a good reason to use AWD vs. RWD or FWD alone (and usually that's because there is so much available power -- 500+ hp -- that the loss is worth the other tradeoffs).", "Most answers are wrong. The main reason for FWD is that it handles easier. If you lose grip, the car behaves calmly and nicely, instead of going into a fishtail that requires some skill to control. That said, with skill, you can do a lot more with RWD, but, the sad truth is that very few drivers have that skill (even if many think they have). This is why racing cars often have RWD (and because it's easier to put a large engine in and transfer the power from a large engine without things breaking). RWD is actually easier to build. Sure, the drive shaft is a little longer, but the mechanics are simpler. It's not a coincidence that RWD came before FWD. So, why not on motorcycles. Well, the front wheel is also a large part of how you keep the balance. So, if it looses grip, you get a very nasty situation. Anyone who has tried using the front brake on a bike on ice knows that it's painful. This is not a problem with cars, as they aren't very prone to tipping over.", "It would be difficult to steer with a chain linked from the engine or pedals to the front wheel on a bike."]}

{"example_id": 139, "context": "", "question": "How can people doubt huge moments in history, like the holocaust or men landing on the moon?", "answer": ["Have you considered why you believe that the Holocaust happened? Think about it. You believe that it happened because people you trust told you it did. You believe that there is a huge amount of evidence because those same people that you trust told you that there is. Have you examined the evidence yourself? Have you examined huge numbers of written accounts, and analyzed their accuracy? Have you visited the camps, spent years studying forensics, and collected the evidence you need to make a conclusion? Have you even gained enough knowledge to critically examine the work of the people who *do* claim to have done these things? Have you actually looked through the body of \"videos and photos\" and considered whether they constitute real evidence for the claims involved? Have you looked at Nazi records discussing mass extermination? I suspect that 99% of the people on this subreddit have not done all this. I certainly haven't. Now, I tend to trust the historians who have actually studied World War II. They put in the time, and they say it happened, so I accept that it happened. But I can't pretend that I did the work to gain that knowledge myself - someone else did that, and my acceptance of the Holocaust as a fact depends on my trust of those people. So if you don't trust the establishment, whether that be the government, or historians, or the mainstream media, then it's very easy to doubt the work that they have done, since almost nobody has actually examined the evidence themselves. This holds true for almost all historical events. If I don't trust the US government to tell the truth for shit, then why should I believe that the first moon landing was anything other than a propaganda piece? All the evidence that says it happened is sourced from somebody I don't trust, and I'm sure as hell not going to go the moon myself to check. This is why people disbelieve historical events - they don't trust the people who are the sole providers of evidence, and they are not able to put in the years of work to actually accumulate the evidence themselves.", "Belief is basically accepting the proof. No matter what proof is given to some people, for whatever reason their minds will not accept the evidence. For example - Lets say *I don't believe in China.* I've never **seen** it. I've never traveled that far. Hell, as far as I know it could be some huge crazy thing and I'm in my own version of the Truman Show. You could tell me all about China, show me pictures, videos, whatever, but I think it's all part of your conspiracy to trick me. The proof is not proof because it's all part of the deception. So you fly me to China, show me the view from above and we land and walk around. Okay now I **see it**, I believe it. You can't do that with past events. You can't take the JFK conspiracy people back to when he was killed and *show* them. No evidence put before them will be believed because they think it's all propaganda.", "When it comes to any 'huge' moment in history we are depending on those who write the history to determine, first of all, what constitutes \"huge\" events, and secondly how they unfolded. There are many events in History that are lost to many, simply because they are underreported. If things can be lost, who is to say things can't be added?", "Here's what most people think about themselves. They are presented with an idea (say the holocaust happened). They consider they evidence. They listen to the arguments. And using their reason, they deduce a conclusion (true). Here's reality. They are presented with an idea. They consider whether or not they want to believe that idea. Does it fit with what I already believe? Would it put me in a tough position if it were true? How will my peers react if I believe this? They reach a conclusion. They then nod as they consider the evidence and arguments in their favor, and shake their heads at everything else. Sounds stupid, but everyone acts this way. Including me. Including you. The truth of the matter is, it's really hard to prove things. If you only believed what you could definitively prove, you wouldn't believe much at all. People who doubt these events aren't less capable of reason than those who do. Instead, they disagree because they have different initial biases. I recommend reading Bertrand Russel's \"The Problems of Philosophy\". In his first few chapters, he shows how hard it is to prove even that anything exists at all (that is, the world isn't an illusion). If you can easily doubt they existence of the entire world, well then it's easy to doubt any particular event now isn't it?", "Now, I believe that the Holocaust happened. I'm Jewish, and members of my family were greatly affected by it. But in Germany, Austria, and surrounding countries, it's *illegal* to deny the Holocaust.

Doesn't that make it sound like a big conspiracy?", "Denying something commonly known, as well as claiming something commonly denied, is a way of feeling special. Whether to compensate for some social or personal issue, or to conform to some stereotype is for a therapist to determine, but the feeling is the same: when you believe something against the common consensus you get this \"have-seen-the-matrix\" feeling that is addictive and ego-boosting. That is why a conspirscy theorist will tend to pick up many fringe beliefs and even mix them. 9/11 is an inside job + aliens = aliens did 9/11 as an inside job therefore US president is alien. Trying to reason with them except for the casual believer (if someone rather naive runs into a conspiracy group might pick up on the beliefs until shown how stupid they compare to reality) is a waste of time because you are attempting to deny them a huge pleasure.", "Plato's Allegory of the Cave is a possible reason. The basics of it are that the experiance of the individual is their reality, and even when exposed to the \"Truth\" of something they preffer the fictional perceptions because it relates back to their experiances. The process to accept a new reality are sometimes painful and so people avoid changing their perceptions if it causes them injury. Another way to describe this reaction is bias. People unconciously preffer to believe in a lie if it is more comfortable than the truth (IE I got fired because my boss didn't like me, not I was a poor employee). There are alternate reasons as well beyond subconcious denial. For example if I told you that Nasa had made contact with an intelligent alien life form but hid it from the world, would you believe me? Probobly (hopefully) not, but what if it appeared on CNN BBC Fox ABC NBC the cover of Time magazine and every major paper in America? You likely would believe it, even though you never saw the aliens yourself. There is some logic behind that choice, but either way you cant know for sure because it is an event in the past. Your rely upon a judgement of how credible the source of information is. People who deny major historic events often cite that the credibility of the source of the primary evidence is inadequte. This in itself might be a logical reason for dismissing a source of information. Take the moon landing as your cited example. Often moon denyers will state that Nasa and the US government have a motive to decieve people into believing there was a moon landing. Since all of the source material (lets ignore the laser reflection devices left on the moon for now) originates from a government controlled source and that source has a viable motive for not telling the truth if they did not land on the moon, they cannot be trusted. Since the source is suspect and it conflicts with their personal belief that we did not land on the moon, it is easier to deny it and create a false reality for yourself than it is to change that belief. To take your example of the Bible, a person who has for the majority of their life been told that the Bible was true by trusted sources will believe that. In order to change that belief they would have to accept some uncomfortable changes to their world view, for example death does not lead you to a heaven or hell, you just stop existing. That would be a pretty uncomfortable truth to accept for someone who believed their faithfulness and good deeds would be rewarded and their abstinance from committing sins appreciated after death. Confirmation Bias is a tendency to look for facts situations or explanations that justify an already held belief. Back to the moon landing, people stating that the flag in the video would not wave in the vaccum of space on the moon view the flag moving as proof that the entire thing was a hoax (this was disproven on mythbusters a while back, pretty good episode). In either case, confirmation bias leads them to believe that the waving flag is proof they are correct. TLDR * When accepting a new peice of information as a fact, if the fact is aversive to already held beliefs it is easy to dismiss as incorrect. * People have a bias towards certain types of sources and against others. * Confirmation bias reinforces the incorrect or misinterpreted facts in the eyes of an observer.", "You know, the US president during the holocaust knew people would say the holocaust never happened, so he ordered shut tons of photographs to be taken", "I expect to get some backlash on this, if anyone gets around to reading it, but here goes. I would wholly appreciate if anyone can convince me to change my mind on any of this. To start off, reality is a pervasive thing. Especially the reality of the past. Every time you remember a memory, that memory has the potential to be altered. There was a woman who had fully convinced herself she was present at the twin towers on 9/11, when she wasn't actually there at all. Regression hypnosis therapy was an extremely popular thing for a while, until we started to realize how fragile memory was. Lots of people wound up in jail, because therapists trying to 'unlock' repressed memories of abuse in their patients would actually *create* those memories. Patients who were not actually abused would come out of regression hypnosis therapy with vivid memories of ha inn been abused as children. Really, people's minds are open books, ready to believe whatever they're told. So, now that I've hopefully explained *how* people can just believe whatever, let me try and answer the *why*. I'll start with the religion one, since that's surprisingly the less controversial answer. Simply put, telling myths full of miracles provides the people telling them with power over the people believing them. If you say \"I want you to give me 10% of your money every week\", no one will do it. But, if you say \"God created man, man sinned, and was condemned to hell. But God was loving enough to send his son Jesus to earth to perform miracles to prove he was God's son, and then die for our sins on the cross, so that as long as people know about him they won't go to hell. Believe in him, and you won't go to hell. Also, btw, if you care about everyone, please give me 10% of your money every week so that I can keep telling people about Jesus so they won't go to hell.\" Well, now you're getting somewhere. So, people believe it because they're gullible, and they're told it because someone else benefited from telling them that lie. Now down to the meaty part of your question -- Why *do* people believe in things like moon landing and holocaust denialism? At this point, we start to enter territory where truth is like a treacherous swamp, full of sinkholes and crocodiles. There will be all kinds of differing opinions because this is an area where truth has been so skewed that people for the most part just don't know what to believe. Regardless, it's a real that I'm fascinated with, and so I'm pretty sure what I'm about to say is the truth. Repeat after me these two words. *Conspiracy Theory*. Don't they make you feel kind of dirty? Why is that? A conspiracy is just a plot by a group of people to accomplish a goal. If you think about it, it's actually absurd to suggest that powerful people *don't* conspire to get things done. In a world ruled by money, it doesn't matter how you got that money. If you look around you, I'm sure you'll see that the noblest people are often the poorest. That's because they don't think it's worth violating the law or lying to people to make money. Any 'legitimate' business that makes a sufficient amount of money is pushed flush up against the line of legality and is usually well past the line of morality. Beyond that line of legality is a whole world of illegal business. Money is money. 'Legitimate' business do deals with criminals, such as banks laundering money for drug cartels. Look at the Iran-Contra scandal, for example. That was *our own government* buying and selling *illegal drugs* in order to fund the contras and provide weapons to Iran. The whole reason they're doing this is to manipulate the working parts of our society to create advantages for American businesses to prosper. That's why countless democratic governments have been overthrown by CIA coups throughout the years. That's why JFK was assassinated, and why the twin towers fell. 'Okay -- hold up. You can't prove those last two edgarallenbro. Those are just *conspiracy theories*.' Well, that's true. When conspiracies are proven, we no longer call them conspiracies. We refer to them as 'scandals' or the like. The fact of the matter is that the CIA tried VERY hard to cover up the Iran-Contra scandal, and nearly succeeded. The journalist who first sought to expose it is dead, allegedly from suicide, although it is likely that he was killed, and it was made to look like suicide. Things like the JFK assassination and 9/11 have so far been covered up with much more ferocity, due to the implications of people knowing the truth. So what does any of this have to do with the moon landing or holocaust denial? Those things are one of the many ways in which institutions like the CIA have sought to cover up their clandestine actions by manipulating public opinion. By introducing clearly ludicrous theories like holocaust denial, moon landing denial, hollow earth theory, reptile people, etc. etc. etc., they have been able to delegitimize serious theories. A lot of the 'people' you see believing these theories *do not actually believe them*. Many of them don't even actually *exist!* There are identities that are *proponents* of these theories that have been revealed to be government operatives. They are straw men, meant to convince *just enough* gullible people to go along with them so that *you*, the average person, are convinced that 'people will believe anything'. This is so that you can turn around and say \"Well, I know there are people who believe JFK wasn't assassinated at the hands of a lone gunmen, but there are also people who believe that the holocaust was a a hoax. They're all just crazy conspiracy theories.\" and the people who are willing to do unbelievable things to seize and maintain power can continue to get away with it.", "Damn. I had this huge thing written up and somehow something crashed and ah... anyway There's a lot of reasons. History's written by the victors The government has proven they'll do shady things (and in times of war have more reason to) We've recently found out just in the last few decades that stuff they were commonly teaching when I was a kid was complete bullshit (like Columbus discovering America and Paul Revere \"the red coats are coming\") This makes us more skeptical about the history we already know And the moon landing is an easy target . Firstly it's mind blowing to think they went to the moon back in an age of such crappy technology. The same people with no cell phones and no personal computers went to the moon? Secondly; the fact that we haven't hardly gone back since the 70's If you look at the way every other technology has progressed you'd think we'd be taking tourists to the moon by now, instead it seems like we're exactly where we were in the 60's as far as going to the moon is concerned And that's hard to believe In general, the same government that came up with a plan to blow up an airliner near Cuba and blame it on them---which only didn't happen because the president said no--- the same government that doused an entire town with lsd .... It's not hard to believe they'd fake a moon landing to get one up on some commie bastards Edit: also while I haven't surly fact check this, I heard somewhere that some scientist have said there's a problem with radiation that we still haven't solved today that would have made it impossible to go to the moon in the 60s", "The truth is a north Korean is confronted routinely with fake evidence that their leader has divine powers and that there is starvation in America.

You will find that all moon landing deniers and holocaust deniers have strongly negative feelings about the US government.", "Human memory is a very complex thing. Recall of a memory refers to the subsequent re-accessing of events or information from the past, which have been previously encoded and stored in the brain. In common parlance, it is known as remembering. During recall, the brain \"replays\" a pattern of neural activity that was originally generated in response to a particular event, echoing the brain's perception of the real event. In fact, there is no real solid distinction between the act of remembering and the act of thinking. These replays are not quite identical to the original, though - otherwise we would not know the difference between the genuine experience and the memory - but are mixed with an awareness of the current situation. Memories are not frozen in time, and new information and suggestions may become incorporated into old memories over time. Thus, remembering can be thought of as an act of creative reimagination. Because of the way memories are encoded and stored, memory recall is effectively an on-the-fly reconstruction of elements scattered throughout various areas of our brains. Memories are not stored in our brains like books on library shelves, or even as a collection of self-contained recordings or pictures or video clips, but may be better thought of as a kind of collage or a jigsaw puzzle, involving different elements stored in disparate parts of the brain linked together by associations and neural networks. Memory retrieval therefore requires re-visiting the nerve pathways the brain formed when encoding the memory, and the strength of those pathways determines how quickly the memory can be recalled. Recall effectively returns a memory from long-term storage to short-term or working memory, where it can be accessed, in a kind of mirror image of the encoding process. It is then re-stored back in long-term memory, thus re-consolidating and strengthening it. When people get a false notion in their head, it colors all the recollections that come after it. Over time, the person remembers the past quite differently than it really was. Additional evidence doesn't fix this, because it doesn't code consistently with the person's memories. So a bible story that doesn't change (because the pages in the book don't change) much more effectively reinforces itself than exposure to new facts.", "A few years ago I looked into 'Holocaust Deniers' and really I was just interested in the whole 'Holocaust' story and its something like the way they portray 'Climate Deniers' (note using the same 'Deniers' word for association). In fact, very very few people (none I found) deny there was most definitely a horrific oppression, that many Jews were put in camps and that many many people died. Waiiiit! But they are 'Deniers!' like you know 'climate deniers' deny ANY man-made or ANY warming or they deny Co2 Exists! No, actually most of the 'holocaust denial' documentaries ranged from very moderate questioning of 'methods' and doubting numbers like '6 million'. But I didn't come across too many who just declare 'nothing ever happened!'. Whats sorta sad is that for people who just genuinely want to learn and understand there was just such a hyper-charged defense mechanism where in one case a dutiful scientists who simply did NOT find gas in samples was pretty much destroyed and humiliated as a 'Holocaust Denier'. Another young Jewish man got to have his life destroyed when on a pilgrimate to a camp he simply pointed out technical problems with the 'holocaust narrative' and what was actually preserved. He seems to have gone into hiding as a 'vile antisemite' despite being a Jew who wasn't actually saying 'the holocaust totally never happened'.

(\"I cant get to the moon, so clearly my incompetent government couldn't have done that either.\") Some people need there to be an all-powerful and downright mean force in the universe that is responsible for their own failures and shortcommings. (e.g. \"I'm a great guy with plenty o smarts, so the only reason that I must be failing is that *random* *villianous* *organization* has decided to work tirelessly against my efforts.\") Next to last, \"There must be an option that leaves me completely safe and in control.\" Though this is more of the \"homeopathy\" and \"vaccine denial\" mind set. It's an intimate denial rather than a global one, but it's in the same spectrum since it scales up to conspiracy theories about \"big pharma\" and genocide. Finally there is simple fear. If that could happen there and then, then it can happen here and now. Therefore, it must not have happened because that would be just awful. Every behavior \"pays its freight\" with the person exhibiting that behavior. Ask yourself \"What is this person paying themselves by denying the murder of seven million jews?\" You'll usually find the denier is really protecting a world view that some solution, final or otherwise, is \"possible\", for a problem they've manufactured amidst a community that they value. \"All my friends are Nazis so Nazis can't be as bad as all that, so clearly someone is just trying to make them look bad to keep them from their rightful personal and professional success.\" On a siding rail, some people are desperate to feel that they know what others do not. They need to be \"an initiate in secret truths\". This need _requries_ that what most people believe is indeed false.

This keeper of inner mysteries is then both champion and martyr of their special truth. \"I know the truth, and they cannot see, for I a wise and they are sheep.\" (It's an inferiority complex re-written as projection.) In short, most people are desperate to simplify their world without the hassle of examining their world-views. They need to be right and they need to be special. The easiest way to do that is to deny facts that don't fit their own ideals.

I'm betting I'm banned from like 18 countries and 100+ subreddits now; look it up some time try to get a balanced perspective, look up jewish researchers refuting the claims of deniers and tell me those documents don't wrangle the english language down to the ground and make you want to stop reading them, the most serious one's I could find are tens of pages long and and even though they cared enough to write so much and find sources they don't even take the claim seriously. They developed an entire vernacular just to discus the topic, that centers around the pre-supposition of proof and emotional appeal; you need a primer in \"holocaust revisionism\" before you even understand half of what they say and then you realize they still don't refute any of the actual points they just try to move goalposts and ignore the basic math and proof of inflated numbers being persistent in early war propaganda, \"the 6 million\" shows up in propaganda long before the end of the war.", "Because history is written by the victors. Common held beliefs of history change all the time. We can for example, look at certain Roman accounts of battles. \"Well it says here they killed thirty thousand enemies, but we now know the enemy army was most likely only 20 thousand strong\" This is something that no one has any problem questioning because it happened X amount of time ago. People (rightly) doubt things because of this. Remember not to confuse those of us who believe an event like the holocaust is exaggerated with those who deny it happened outright. For example, nearly 57% of people who were surveyed across the globe believe the Holocaust to be exaggerated. This does not mean they deny it happened. There are discrepancies about previously held public \"knowledge\" about the holocaust. The term \"denier\" gets thrown at anyone who questions the numbers and methods used. Most people still believe the common notion of \"6 million Jews were gassed or executed!\" Which we know to be inaccurate. But anyone who tries to discuss these historical inaccuracies (mostly presented by the Soviets, mind you. A nation renown for lying and exaggerating for propaganda purposes) is instantly shouted down. There isn't a single Nazi document of plans, ideas or even methods pertaining to an undertaking of gassing or otherwise executing millions of Jews. Were Jews killed? absolutely. It was a terrible time and millions of people from all over the world were killed. It's no real surprise though, as the holocaust is still used as justification to this day for certain groups of people to treat other people like shit. This comment will more than likely be down voted and will likely not even receive a response other than personal attacks and insults. Challenging common held misconceptions makes people feel uncomfortable.", "A similar thing happens much more commonly with racism and sexism. There are people who believe that there is no such thing as white male privilege and will deny it, in spite of the mountain of evidence that says otherwise", "Most of these comments are completely missing the point. The human mind is capable of all kinds of delusional thinking in all aspects of life. That is how 93% of people believe they are above average drivers and that flying in a plane is more dangerous than getting on the highway tomorrow. Our brains distort and change the world around us based on what we want to believe. Want to ride a motocycle? Eventually you will come to believe that the staristics do not apply to you and that you won't be the one who is road meat. We rarely see reality, only our perception of it. This is how people who are obese can believe that their diet has no effect on what they are doing and continue to eat exactly the same way. People believe all kinds of crazy nonsense every single day of their lives big and small. If you are a person with little to no critical thinking ability then you will happily glance at the world, come up with an opinion based on that cursary examination and believe the echos in your own mind. The top post asks whether you have ever done anaylsis of WWII holocaust and how you came to believe it. You don't need trust people who \"told you about it\" when you have your own independent verification system called your senses, aka your eyes and ears as well as a basic understanding of the mechanisms by which your brain distorts the truth. Now unless you want to get into solipsism and brains and in vat which basically says we can't prove anything except we exist let's just agree for the sake of this particular post that there is a consensus reality out there that is independent of us or at the very least that there are other entities who are not us, aka external or objective reality, aka the other minds problem. Now to verify go ahead and do the following: Join a Pinterest group of old photos for five minutes do a search for WWII. Now look at them. Done. Now read a few books from survivors. Done. Or if you don't have the time to do even the most basic research then go into a book store for five minutes and simply scan the number of books on the subject. After that you now have only three logical choices. One, you can believe that every single photo is fabricated and that all those books by independent actors are part of a vast conspiracy to defraud you. Two you can assume that based on the amount of imagery and accounts out there that it is probably correct simply based on the sheer effort it would take to defraud the whole world for no particularly good reason or profit. Three you can fall back on solipsism and say there is no way to independently verify anything, that your senses are faulty and that the reality you see is an illusion. While the third may work in philosophy class, I am going to go with number two. Most people do but there are a number of people who can't consciously go through the process that I have outlined and all of this happens below the surface of their consciousness and they are prone to believing one, without having any understanding of why. This essentially makes them non player character in their own lives. As I said earlier people believe all kinds of delusions on a daily basis. Is it really any surprise when someone believes some big ones too? Just watch any of the political debates and you will see that grown people are capable of the most insane belief systems because they have no understanding of how or why they believe anything. In short people's brains are generally broken, as is evidenced by the sheer number of logical fallacies we are capable of using at any point of any day. It's no wonder people choose to disbelieve what is right in front of them.", "So I [19M from UK] have been to Poland, been to Birkenau and Auschwitz, I've spoken to holocaust survivors and the families of those lost during the holocaust. I've been through their museums, and studied the primary sources. I went a few years ago, when I was 16, part of a school trip. Perhaps this is an American thing? I've heard of Holocaust deniers, but have never met one, I've been to Germany too and I don't think many there deny it. This whole idea seems ludicrous to me. An interesting book is 'The Gulf War Did Not Take Place' by Jean Baudrillard, in which he argues that from the eyes of everyone who wasn't directly militarily involved, the Gulf War was not a real war. This is interesting, obviously Baudrillard knows it factually occurred, he discusses the idea of media control and the distance of Modern to war to civilians of Nato; to very briefly summarise. I like this concept. However to something like the Holocaust this cannot be applied. For me the moon landing is different, as it is entirely controlled, all the footage is controlled by the Government, and the staff of NASA too.

Proving the last, intent, is probably the hardest job for historians. When it comes to specific evidence the rationalization for dismissing them assumes many forms. * For eye-witness accounts, depending on when those accounts were given, they will be dismissed due to bad memory if it has been decades since the events in question, or some type of bias against those being accused if it's immediately after the event(s). * Interviews with perpetrators, like SS guards or the heads of concentration/death camps, that detail what happened are readily dismissed with the idea that they were coerced by interviewers. * With respect to photos and videos, they were doctored. These are \"simple\" arguments that get much more complex and complicated when you dissect and deconstruct them. More so, they support already established belief systems; conspiracy theories are a dime a dozen, if you believe in one there's that much more reason to believe others.", "A lot of conspiracy theories are fueled by people's distrust of government/authority figures in general which by itself makes perfect sense, I think. I mean a lot of the structure of the US government was centered around the idea that the government shouldn't always be trusted and usually that its not in the people's best interest to trust them. On top of that while a lot of conspiracy theories are pretty loopy the reaction to them is often pretty irrational as well. Whenever someone suggests that 9/11 is an inside job or the moon landing never happened suddenly others feel entitled to act like they themselves know anything about physics or architectural stability of sky scrapers when they've probably not even done the cursory amount of research the conspiracy theorist has.

Whenever a group of people secret try to undermine or exploit another group, that's a conspiracy and there are tons of examples of it actually happening throughout history.", "I genuinely believe.

One of the most brutal things I've ever witnessed and that was just whats left as an aftermath. Someone would have had to go pretty fucking far to fake that. I think it's healthy to question things but if you disbelieve, go and prove it/disprove it to yourself first before repeating the Internet and telling everyone else!", "Not that I follow this line of thinking, but all of the examples you provided (videos, photos, witnesses) can be fabricated. They can also be propaganda where they only show a half truth due to political reasons. After all, historical perspective often boils down to an ideology that the masses choose to accept and propagate. For example, how often are the Japanese internment camps mentioned in the US when discussing WW2? The answer is \"not very often\" in the US. A nation denying that they do not do despicable acts, and their populace believing them/not caring, is par for the course. Just look at Guantanamo or the black sites in Chicago for examples.", "I know this is my most controversial reply yet, but...

He said there were so many dead bodies laying around, all that the Allies could do was to bulldoze them into the existing mass graves. There were too many dead bodies to be handled individually.", "Well, the two things aren't the same. There is overwhelming evidence the holocaust happened, the only real matter of debate was just how high the death count was. Absolute deniers do so out of hatred for Gypsies or Jews and not historical fact. The moonlanding is a different kettle of fish; it's a binary thing, so it either happened or it didn't happen.

Most of these stupid english rules (passive is incorrect, don't split infinitives, don't end sentences in prepositions, etc) came from grammar books published in the 18th and 19th century by people who wanted English to read more like Latin, which they thought was a more scholarly language. It's a form of [linguistic prescription]( URL_1 ), which basically means telling people how they ought to be speaking/writing. See also:  URL_0 ", "The passive voice certainly has its uses. A quick scan of the wikipedia entry and I found this: Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage (1994) recommends the passive voice when identifying the object (receiver) of the action is more important than the subject (agent), and when the agent is unknown, unimportant, or not worth mentioning: The child was struck by the car. The store was robbed last night. In the sentence where the child was struck by the car, the focus of the writer or speaker's intent is the child, not the car. Had the sentence read \"the car struck the child\", then the focus would be on the car as it is the subject of the sentence. In the passive voice, the child is the focus of the sentence (despite the fact that the car is still the subject - I think) and some action is being done *to* it.", "There's nothing inherently wrong with it. Often, sentences structured that way can sound stilted, awkward, or wordy, which is why a lot of English teachers will tell you not to use passive voice. In this case, the problem isn't with the passive voice itself, but with inexperienced writers' inability to use it effectively. It certainly doesn't come very naturally, except in cases of victimization; most often, sentences will read more clearly and be more concise in active voice. However, if you're planning to publish any sort of scientific paper ever in your life, it's best not to listen to those English teachers, because you'll need those passive-voice-ification skills they're trying to drill out of you. Overall, it's generally best to learn where and when passive voice is most effective, use it in those cases, and stick to active voice elsewhere.", "We're taught that it is \"bad\" because usually an active voice makes the sentence easier to understand. We've grown up with most of our sentences following a \"subject verb\" structure. Passive - The ball was thrown by the boy. Active - The boy threw the ball.

The reason we're so keep to keep it lifeless is because we're trying to figure out if there is life there already or if there ever was.

In rechargeable batteries, applying electric energy can reverse these reactions to restore the original state in wich electric energy can be produced, effectively \"storing\" electric energy.

I don't have the original quote, nor do I remember who said it, so I'm not claiming this as my own. Think of a battery as a cup you use to drink water. Imagine everytime you fill the water cup, it forms a very thin layer of ice on the bottom that never melts. The layer is so thin that you won't notice the ice buildup until you've used it very many times. Eventually you've got a cup that can only hold a tiny amount of water. Now replace ice with rock salt and water with ions and that's the explanation with batteries. When Lithium ions move across the electrode while charging, they form a rock salt in the battery.", "Take something that is flexible and bend it a few times. After a while, it tends to permanently deform, and does not snap back as much or weakens where it was bent, or just snaps. Batteries can be thought of in similar fashion. The stress of recharge cycles eventually causes part of the battery to lose the ability to hold a charge.", "In the case of lead-acid, the \"plate\" is a thin leaf of Pb (negative) and PbO2 (positive) and the reaction absorbs the sulfide ion from the sulfuric acid electrolyte to convert both plates to lead(II) sulfate (PbSO4). It's reversible, of course... but it's like this. If you had an iron plate and it scales apart into rust, and electrolytically turned the rust back into iron, it's not a plate anymore, is it? Lead plates can be cycled about 300 times total. The material swells and contracts during discharge/recharge and slowly falls apart. It flakes off bits of lead, it cracks which disconnects a part of the plate from the terminal. There is a porous separator (a plastic or rubber mesh) between the positive and negative plates to allow them to be sandwiched very close to keep the resistance down, while separating them to prevent a short. Flakes shedding off pack into the separator and can poke through, resulting in a short. You might envision it as \"plating\" a new lead surface when it's recharged. That's not it- *the lead never moves in either plate*. The sulfide ion moves in and out of the electrolyte. The plate must be thin and porous on a molecular level (because each lead molecute can only react with electrolyte it's in contact with, otherwise the lead is useless). You might think \"well we could glue the lead to fiberglass cloth to hold it together\" but the lead will still flake and crack apart and come off at about the same point. You might say \"well let's make the lead plate like 1/4\" thick\" but then the battery would only have like 5% of the capacity it should for its size- and the shedding flakes off the plate surface will STILL clog the separator. People often ask \"well can't I just wash out the old electrolyte with new and fix the battery\"? Well, each cell is like 200 plates of interleaved positive/separator/neg plates with flaked bits of plate packed into the separator. The flaked stuff is insoluble and can't be washed out. Replacing the electrolyte fixes nothing. It can only be truly reformed by melting it back down and rolling it down into a new sheet during remfg. In the case of NiCd/NiMH/NiFe Edison cells (rare, used early 20th cent), it's different- the plates don't really break down. Rather, every time we charge them, the electrolyte loses a bit of water. In the typical sealed \"AA\" steel-can battery, there's no surplus electrolyte, and no way to refill them. But there ARE very uncommon flooded-plate NiCd/NiMH/NiFe batteries which you can add distilled water to. I have a lot of vintage flooded-plate NiCd that work fine that I sell on eBay. These DO last basically forever. It's crazy how long they last. But they do require maintenance and their charging cycle management is a bit crazy. The NiCd/NiMH/NiFe has one other enemy- carbonation. Regardless of whether they're the sealed type or not. The electrolyte is a strong base (not acid) of potassium hydroxide. If exposed to air, it absorbs carbon from the small trace of CO2 in the air and forms potassium carbonate, which is chemically useless and charging doesn't reverse that back into hydroxide. However... you CAN simply drain the electrolyte and mix up new KOH and refurbish the cell like-new again."]}

The biggest problem is that indigenous Australians aren't one people, there's something like 300 separate nations. While they obviously share common ground, each group has different wants and needs so rather than trying to solve one problem you're trying to solve hundreds. There are various indigenous spokespeople, but some people don't like them either because they're from a different tribe or because they feel they've been whitewashed. All in all, even just organising a proper meeting to discuss the injustice indigenous Australians face (with all stakeholders involved) is a hard task, let alone actually solving the problems. In terms of actually solving the problems, a lot of indigenous people distrust whitefella institutions like hospitals and the like. Up until 1970 the government stole indigenous people from their families to be raised by white families, foster homes and the church. Since it's so recent, a decent proportion of the current indigenous population were involved in that and understandably don't want that to happen to their kids/grandkids. On a similar note, a big problem in indigenous communities is child abuse, which is normally solved by removing the child from their abusers. Obviously after the horrors of the stolen generation this is avoided wherever possible, which means the abuse continues and can propogate through generations. Another big thing is that Australia is so barren that some indigenous communities are so remote that it's hard to provide support, even where it's wanted. That said, a lot (but not all) of the more remote communities are happy living the way they do and we generally let them just do their thing. Death in custody is a big issue too. Obviously there's cases of police brutality and the like, but there's also a high suicide rate too. Indigenous Australians have a VERY strong connection to the land and their extended family and depriving them of that by incarcerating them causes extreme mental anguish, often driving them to end their lives.

Indigenous Australians are the oldest surviving culture on earth, descending from those who left Africa 75,000 years ago, when they arrived Australia was lush and full of mega fauna. Over thousands of years they changed the landscape, created hundreds of languages and over 250 separate nations. The vast majority of Aborigines died as a result of white settlement due to disease, of those remaining many were massacred, put into slavery, bred out or hired to hunt other indigenous people as trackers. Indigenous Australians today face issues arising from the denial of education, the mental health issues and substance abuse that stem from those traumatic circumstances and the racism that paints such a horribly inaccurate depiction of many Indigenous Australians. The statistics for incarceration, substance abuse and violence in the indigenous population are shameful. Other countries have schemes in place to create awareness and fix the issues that were created in less accepting times. Australia has put little effort or funding into the areas it should, education and rehabilitation. In recent years they have done the opposite, they threatened to throw many communities off their land, cut funding to many schemes to help young indigenous to create a better life for themselves and closed others schemes that were beneficial but not important enough to keep according the Abbott government. I really love my country, but I hate how little they have done to right these wrongs, they seem to put more effort into sweeping these issues under the rug than actually creating solutions to bring back quality of life for the founders of this land.", "Government assistance to the indigenous of Australia is often literally enough have for them to not work and still have enough to eat, a house to live in, tobacco to smoke and beer to drink on the weekends (restrictions apply). It's harsh to say but in small towns that's all many of them do. Alcohol and drug abuse rates are high, and work rates are low. Children are often taught to do the same. I'm mainly talking about the town-camp style areas, and have only the NT as my reference. I do realize that the indigenous are normal people and am not saying anything about race, merely groups and culture.", "Fundamentally I'd argue it is because the technological gap between them and their colonizer was the widest of any of those relationships. In, say, the American colonies the English settlers had to at least pretend to deal with the American tribes as something like equals. The level of English technology, on the other hand, was vastly higher in 1787 (First Fleet lands in Australia) while the level of technological sophistication (and social sophistication for that matter) among the Australian aborigines was much lower than North American Indians. It would have been impossible, for example, for the American colonists to have treated North America as terra nullius as happened in Australia. Edit: and just to add a bit, this was true even within Australia. The Tasmanian aborigine population, for example, was the least technologically advanced of all the native populations in Australia (they had lost the ability to make stone tools, for example) and were completely wiped out.", "It's a tough problem, and \"why\" can't simply be answered. If you had to look at broad reasons, I'd suggest the following. I now believe (I used not to) that the way to begin to address this is a formal treaty with the Aboriginal and Torrest Strait Islander people. Not all Australians would agree with me. But a successful [referendum]( URL_0 ) on constitutional recognition of the original inhabitants will be a fine start, and one I think will be successful. * Erosion of cultural identity through loss of land (either it being appropriated or the people forcefully moved) * Linked to this is loss of spiritual identity, closely related to place * Forced removal leading to a loss of practical parenting skills as well as the loss of opportuntity to practice traditional parenting * Clear past and present discrimination, leading to social and economic marginalisation * Grief and anger at these lead to mental issues, alcohol abuse, violence which is handed down across the generations. Patterns of behaviour establish themselves. * Sexual and physical violence (including genocide) perpetrated by whites to which aboriginals were powerless to respond * All leading to trouble with the law, continued disadvantage * A basic misunderstanding (or refusal to understand) Aboriginal culture in the past leading to destructive policies that may well have been well intentioned.", "I think at the moment the problem comes from both sides. Up to the '70s the Australian government treated the aboriginals abhorrent. That has changed now. Huge amounts of money are poured into the aboriginal communities. Some laws, to right the wrongs of the past are even completely over the top. However, all this hasn't worked very well yet. There are quite a few individuals that have done great, but not the majority. Partly because aboriginals don't trust the white people anymore. Partly because they are indifferent and as long as they get handouts they don't give a f. There are a few aboriginals on r/Australia and they seem to know that in order to move forwards, both parties have to pick up their game. The government has to work smarter, not just throw more money at it, and the aboriginal community has to realise that they are not just victims of the past anymore but have to work towards a better future.", "I live in the suburbs about an hour South of Perth, Western Australia, unfortunately some of the seamingly racist comments are very accurate for about 80-90% of the Aboriginal population around here. Don't get the wrong idea, I have met a very nice Chirstian Aboriginal family, but they are very much in the minority around here. Hell, there's actually an Aboriginal \"mafia\" who tried to break into my friends house with axes. This kind of reputation can make it very difficult for people to trust Aborigines, whether that particular person is a criminal or the nicest person in the world.", "One of my best friend, until recently, used to work very closely with Aboriginal communities. He's a Redditor so would be more than happy to do an AMA I'm sure. He's got some... interesting stories.", "No idea about australia, but the natives (indios) of central america got it pretty rough as well", "there's several things and it goes both ways. One is the Indigenous communities lack of education. The Australian Government WANTS indigenous Australians to go to University, get well paying jobs, good educations and improve their conditions but many Indigenous people don't take these offers, instead preferring to live off Centrelink. Secondly, welfare is an issue. The government provides more generous welfare towards Indigenous communities which is fine, many communities are in the middle of the barren Outback and require additional assistance but there are also a significant number of Indigenous Australians who take advantage of welfare which can be seen in some of the poorer suburbs of the main cities (Melbourne, Sydney etc.) where I can see this myself, many Aboriginal people abuse substances and just bum around not doing much. Third, there was an insane amount of mistreatment given to Indigenous Australians behest of the Australian Government many decades ago (Aboriginal Australians were considered \"native fauna\" until the 1960s) which adds to tension between the Government and the Indigenous communities and also kind of puts many Indigenous Australians in a repeating circle of low-income, laziness, vagrancy etc. Fourthly, Indigenous Australians do receive a lot of shit from almost everyone here (although I notice it more in non-Anglo Australians) that they're shit-kicker junkies who drink goon (cheap bagged alcohol), smash darts (smoke cigarettes), hit the sniff (sniff petrol) and steal your shit. The problem is, this isn't actually a stereotype, a lot of Indigenous Australians (\"Abos\" or \"coons\" from the racist fuckwits) live like this which leads to high suicide rates and lots of substance abuse. This all falls into that whole repeating circle of Indigenous life that I mentioned. In America, you really wont hear white people, Hispanic people or anything refer to African Americans as \"Niggers\" to their face, nor will you hear it out loud, Indigenous Australians can and almost always do get insulted non-stop just for walking past someone, it's actually fucking insane how much shit they get. People will move away from an Indigenous person and if they try to talk to someone, they'll get called a dirty abbo and told to fuck off. Really, there's motivation behest of the Government to get the Indigenous communities off the ground and get Indigenous Australians into well paying jobs and a successful life but they staunchly refuse to help themselves and they also get an un-godly amount of shit from almost everyone. They pretty much get decent money from the government and don't have to do shit for it, it's not too hard for them to get so they usually just end up going to that. I'm afraid I might come off as a racist or someone who hates Indigenous people but that's not the case, I grew up with a lot of Indigenous people and I used to have a family sleep in my father's truck because the father of their family would kick them out of the house. He eventually sold their mattresses for drug money then they moved in with us, that's the kind of life many Indigenous children go through (in regards to substance abuse) and am actually half Aboriginal myself (one of my parents were Stolen Generation)."]}
{"example_id": 146, "context": "", "question": "Why do semi trucks leave behind huge chunks of tires on the road?", "answer": ["Can confirm what others have said: They use retreaded tires on tractors in any position except steer (the very front two tires). Retreading is a system by which a used tire has new tread applied to it at a tire plant, thereby making it a \"refurbished\" tire. Retread tires are used on every position on a truck except the steer axle, only new tires go on steer axle (this is the very front two tires on a truck, if they are not new then they are against DOT regulation). Is it safe? By and large, yes, we have never had a major failure across the board in a retread campaign. Do I recommend driving next to a truck or a trailer on the highway? Absolutely not. It isn't even so much because of the tires but because of the driver, sitting on the side of one they usually won't see you, if there is a blowout the tread may hit your car and damage it severely (we have large steel belts, sort of like in your car, but unfurled they would be about the size of your car). Another thing is that if a retread blows then it could blow out other tires, the truck could swerve and destroy your car. If you are on city streets being next to a truck is a lot like being next to a car so I wouldn't worry there but on highways I would suggest sticking as far as you can away from a tractor, especially one that has a trailer attached because trailer tire retreads tend to be several times retreaded tractor tires. tl;dr tractors have copies of copies of copies of tires and therefore trend toward the weaker side. Source: I am a parts manager (that deals with tires every day) for a national trucking company.", "Semi trucks tend to have retreaded tires. Retreading or recapping is a process of recycling an old tire by putting new treads on it. Sometimes these treads give out and tear themselves off leaving a bit of a mess.", "yes a lot of trucks use retreaded or recapped tires but the real reason is because the tire wear out and fail. It common for a truck to go over 200,000 miles in a year. Thats 6.6 times more than the average car. Plus 4.5 times more tires means 30times more chance of tire failure over a normal car", "They drive on low quality retreaded tires, I'm assuming to save money. The tire doesn't hold out long enough and blows out.", "Truck drivers rarely if ever take the time to check tire pressures on all of their tires. Under inflated tires run hotter causing the tread to separate. this happen more often on re-caps, but it will happen on all tires under certain conditions. You never want to run over one of these. They can have sharp metal in them and will flatten your tires in the process. On a side note: never stop next to one of these pieces of tread in the southeast U.S. It might be a gator, the resemblance is startling.", "What happens is they often have their bald tires \"re-treaded\" because it's cheaper than buying new tires. The new tread eventually falls off.", "As others have said here, it is from retreaded tires. That may leave you to wonder why/how they keep on driving after it. What you have to remember is that, unlike in a car, the driver probably can't easily feel if something happens to the rear tire on the truck. In a car, if you have a flat on the front tires, you can know immediately but it is harder (though you still know) on the back tires. Well, imagine a huge truck, on a trailer, and really far back. It would be easy to not notice.", "\"Watch out for them gators, son\" explanation: truckers call them gators.", "Basically, when you drive on a flat tire, it comes apart. Tractor trailer drivers are not always aware that they have a flat tire on the trailer, and the tire gets hot and comes apart from being driven flat for many miles. It is not relevant if the tire is retreaded or not. Non-retreaded tires fail in the same manner. Usually when you pick up a road gator, the retread is still attached to the tire casing. It is true that retreaded tires tend to be older, and very common on trailers and drive positions. They can spontaneously fail, but it is uncommon. Usually, road gators are caused by simply driving on a flat until it comes apart. source : tire shop owner", "Why do they allow retreads in the US when they're so dangerous. I've heard stories of them blowing out near other drivers and risking their lives. I've almost been in accidents before where I or others have to swerve to avoid ones already littering the road. I wish they'd improve the rail network and get rid of semi's altogether.", "Followup question: why the hell here in California freeways are littered with that crap that i have to swerve around all the time while I have never seen that living in France for 25 years?", "In Florida, you have to look twice. What may appear to be a blown out semi truck tire may actually be an alligator sun bathing on the side of the road.", "Alright, so I work in a truckstop tireshop and this is from what I know. Department of Transportation has rules when it comes to tires, the big ones are: -Cannot run a tire with 2/32nds of tread or less. -Cannot run a used tire/retread on steers. -Cannot run a tire with patches, sidewall or otherwise more than three to a quarter of tire. Now this is where shit hits the fan. You'll find drivers, whether they are aware or not, running P.O.S. tires with WAY too little PSI (should be around 100-110 depending) while loaded. It isn't always retreads, but you will get Joe Blow trying to save a buck, and he will do the work at his fleets yard (parking for company trucks) not following any regulations. A good company/fleet might run something from Michelin, where the repairs to the casing of an older tire and the retread were done to DOT regulation. A good driver keeps up with maintenance and replaces what needs to be replaced, but do keep in mind shit happens. Just last night alone, I replaced 3 blown-out tires and I mean all that were left were sidewalls. Two were bad maintenance practice, which was evident from the rest of the trailer/tractor and looking for THE cheapest thing we carry. I wiitnessed an under-the-table deal between two truckers where one had low tread tires (4/32) and sold them to some guy to be mounted to replace his blow out. TL;DR: Some drivers/fleets are just out to make a buck, even if they have to cut corners and risk other drivers.", "I was once passing a big truck on my motorbike on a freeway in Australia. One of the re-tread tires came apart and launched the entire giant chunk of rubber out the side, directly at me about a meter and a half off the ground. I managed to swerve hard and duck as it flew over the top of me. It felt like a Matrix slow-mo as the huge section of rubber skimmed over the top of me. If it had hit me, it would have knocked me off the bike - it was a good 2m long. Hundreds of other little bits of rubber rained off my helmet and body as I accelerated past the truck. I felt incredible bad-ass, but it could have so easily fucked me up.

The need for water you feel there = the need for a cigarette after 2-3 hours. If you don't take one (it's your own choice after all) the need starts to get physical. You lungs start to tickle - not in a bad way. It's like when you scrath something, so it kindda feels good, but also like you want to do something about it - a teasing feeling.

When you smoke a cigarette, very similar chemicals are released and you feel satisfied. When people can't have a cigarette they may get irritable.

{"example_id": 150, "context": "", "question": "Kim Davis, Rowan County, Kentucky who is refusing to issue gay marriage licenses", "answer": ["For anyone who hasn't heard of this whole situation, here's a summary: Kim Davis is the County Clerk for Rowan County, Kentucky. After the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot ban same-sex marriage, she stopped giving out marriage licenses to any couple. Davis based her actions on the idea that same-sex marriage conflicts with her Christian beliefs, so she refuses to be involved with a marriage between people of the same sex. Davis took the matter to court, arguing that her religious views should excuse her from the aspects of her job that she considers immoral. The court did not accept her position, so she appealed, and again the courts said she could not stop issuing marriage licenses. While this was going on, Davis was granted a \"stay,\" which basically said she could keep denying marriage licenses while the matter was in court. The stay just expired and the Supreme Court rejected an extension to the stay. As a result, it's pretty clear that Davis will not be able to get legal permission to continue avoiding issuing marriage licenses. In spite of the courts telling her she needs to issue the licenses, Davis still refuses to do so. By continuing to do this, she risks being fined or jailed at a later point in time. However, because County Clerk is an elected position, she cannot be fired. It is possible that she could impeached by the legislature, but that would not be a simple procedure. TL;DR: County Clerk refuses to give out marriage licenses, citing religious objections to same-sex marriage. Issue goes to court and all rulings go against her. Clerk continues to refuse to give out marriage licenses, but she can't just be fired or anything straightforward like that.", "ELI5: How could she be divorced three times, and still claim religious exemption for a religion she clearly picks and chooses the rules she wishes to follow?", "Think of it like this.

You cannot decide which ones you are going to obey and which ones you are going to ignore when you are an elected official.

{"example_id": 151, "context": "", "question": "There is no archeological evidence that dragons ever existed. So, if they're simply imagined, how is it that they're present in almost every major culture and depicted so similarly?", "answer": ["There are certain things that are common in human mythology, and one of them is that humans are predisposed to be impressed by really big things. And it's easier to imagine a really big version of something that already exists than to design something completely from scratch. Hence why so many cultures have stories of giant humans running around. This applies to other creatures as well; take a reptile of some sort, scale it up to being bigger than a house, and suddenly you've got a dragon of some kind. Imagination adds other embellishments such as horns or breathing fire, or whatever the local variation is. (And they can be pretty varied; consider the differences between a standard European dragon, a Chinese dragon, and the Aztec winged serpent -- but they're all basically big lizards.) Similarly, many cultures have stories of giant birds, be it the ~~European~~ Middle Eastern (thanks productusmaximus!) Roc or the North American Thunderbird. This of course gives rise to the question of why some animals don't seem to get the gargantuan myth treatment as often. To this I can only speculate that when one has to deal with actual bears and tigers and jaguars, stories about even larger ones aren't necessary for drama.", "Asian dragons are depicted completely differently from European style dragons (which were themselves a wide range of dragony things with no consistent appearance). There are only dragons in a **few** major cultures, and most people would not include the flying serpents of central/south american myth as \"dragons\", nor do dragons make appearances in Indian, African, Middle East, or many other \"major\" cultures.", "Short answer:  >  There are two distinct cultural traditions of dragons: the European dragon, derived from European folk traditions and ultimately related to Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies, and the Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan (namely the Japanese dragon), Korea and other East Asian countries.  >  The two traditions may have evolved separately, but have influenced each other to a certain extent, particularly with the cross-cultural contact of recent centuries. [Long Answer]( URL_0 )", "People were finding dinosaur bones long before the modern age, and they had to invent stories to explain them. They came up with dragons.", "The dragons in different cultures and at different times are wildly different in style and mythology. We group a lot of different giant serpent/lizard monster concepts into one heading and call them dragons. The fact that we have a lot of serpent monsters is likely caused by early peoples inability to comprehend snake movements by anything other than magic. In almost all cultures snakes are either symbols of evil or symbols of good, but regardless they are magical.", "The dinosaur fossil thing that many people here mention has a huge problem, it is not actually easily discernible how dinosaurs looked like based on fossils, when the whole fossil craze began it took some time to figure out that these fossilized remains were from things whose skeletons looked similar too that of lizards etc. Our first attempts to reconstruct dinosaurs were often very wrong. It seems a bit unlikely that primitive people all over the world without the tools or the technology that we have could have dug up up dinosaur bones and accurately reconstructed what dinosaurs must have looked like when they were still in the bronze age or ever earlier. The idea also misses the fact that the modern dragon that looks like a big winged lizard who breathes fire is just that a modern thing. If you go back in time you will find that local depictions of what we call dragons tended to be a lot more different from each other and from what we have today. Dragons were frequently described as large serpents or chimeras mad up of different sorts of animals. Many of them were multi headed and limbed and descriptions comparing them to giant lizards are spare. The [proto indo-european religion]( URL_0 ) that most religions in Asia and European and the middle east and Africa were based on and influenced by is thought to have featured a hero/god fighting a large serpent and most modern dpeictions of dragons in Eurasia are probably connected to that. The dragon-like mythical animals in other places like Australia, the Americas or sub-Saharan African only fit the mold of the dragon with a lot more squeezing. So the explanation is more like: Once upon a time some people had a story about a hero slaying a big serpent. That story got exaggerated over the generations and spread throughout half the world to produce myths and religions of gods battling giant serpents. Like Thor vs. Jörmungandr or Marduk vs. Tiamat or even several times in Christian mythology. Over time those descriptions of dragons changed and evolved. when those cultures re-encountered one another they saw the similarities between the concepts and started adapting parts of their neighbours description of the creatures. Eventually dinosaurs were discovered and the by then already pretty dinosaur-like gestalt was influenced by that. People attempted to make creatures from unrelated cultures fir the pattern even if not appropriate and nowadays thanks to modern fantasy stories dragons from around the world look and act very similar.", "There are three predators that hunted and killed early humans (and other mammals) that we instinctively fear; birds of prey, big cats, snakes. A dragon is a manifestation of those three. Finding dinosaur bones only helped fuel our imaginations.", "I used to spend a lot of hours in the library as a child ... I used to read a lot. It was a normal day until a passage in a book I could read \"Dragons do not exist\"... I thought it was a mistake...

When my mother came to pick me at the end of the day I was in tears... My search proved that the dragons really did not exist. That this magnificent and scary at the same time animal was just a myth. Sad moment of my childhood.", "I read a theory somewhere that it's some kind of amalgamated primal-subconscious archetype of our ancestors' most feared predators, the snake, the eagle, and the leopard. Probably quite fanciful but a cool idea", "Note: I wanted to give a logical, legible, and casual examination of the question. As a result, it's pretty dull - but maybe helpful? This question makes me think of the major traits I personally associate with dragons: they're reptilian and they breath fire. Lots of creatures - mythological or plainly observable fly, so I don't think that's critical to the 'idea' of a dragon. Also to be fair, not all 'dragons' are supposed to breath fire - and I'm sure there are plenty of other fire-breathers within various mythologies. I think with the first thing, a mythological creature being described as reptilian in it's physical characteristics is a perfectly natural consequence of people being exposed to snakes, lizards, alligators, turtles, ect. It would be quite strange for a culture to ignore an entire class of animals. It may be the case that there are cultures that depicted 'dragons' that were entirely unaware/unexposed to reptiles of any sort, but were these people also perfectly isolated from people who did? I don't think it is much of a stretch at all, from that point, to expect that a good number of isolated cultures could have conceived of an original version of a reptilian animal inspired by the observance of real, living reptiles. This character, through stories and artwork, would naturally be adopted by other other cultures as people interact with each other and share their ideas. Just as with music, religion, or what have you. So the idea of a dragon becomes attached to other ideas, which become a part of people's collective imaginations, and consequently become a part of those people's cultures. As for the fire-breathing part of the mystery, I think I have a good comparison. The thing that's strange about 'fire-breathing dragons' existing in multiple cultures is that there is no evidence (to my knowledge) of any observable animal being able to expel a stream of fire from it's mouth/nostrils/whatever. I think that's the gist of what we understand from depictions of such dragons. Here's my comparison: zombies eating brains. Zombies are another 'character' that can be observed in many cultures. If we decide that the most basic quality of a 'zombie' is that it is a person that has died who has come back to life, I think most people would agree that it is unsurprising that such an idea could be imagined naturally by many isolated groups of people observing death. Just as it's unsurprising that people familiar with snakes would imagine a special kind of snake. The thing that doesn't follow naturally of observing the real world is the 'brain-eating' part. As with 'brain-eating zombies', the idea of 'fire-breathing dragons' is too specifically fantastic for us to believe that several distinct cultures could have conceived of it naturally. I don't think it's reasonable to conclude from this that 'brain-eating zombies' did in fact exist in a physical capacity. My reasoning in this case is: those ideas are too specific to have originated in isolated cultures in every single individual case. Dragons only properly become 'fire-breathing dragons' once that idea becomes a part of stories and artwork. The stories only have to become popular for them to influence a people's culture. People that are a part of a culture where this popular fiction has not been accepted may very well imagine a fantastic creature that is similar only in being reptilian in nature. TL;DR People who saw reptiles were bound to imagine fantastic exaggerations, which all can be recognized as 'dragons'. Beyond their reptile-inspired characteristics, their similarities could largely be a case of specific incarnations (flying, fire breathing, poisonous, aquatic) becoming especially popular, and thus more likely to spread between cultures.", "Check out real America's most authoritative source: \"Some creation scientists have postulated that the differing nature of dragons in the west and east may be because after the Great Flood, predatory, carnivorous dinosaurs tended to migrate westward, whereas large, plant-eating dinosaurs tended to migrate east from Mt.

Further, when there were similarities, they were akin to very large snakes/serpents.", "First of all, there is no *paleontological evidence*, not archeaology, paleontology. First of all, there are lots of things many societies came to separately. All culture on all corners of the globe have found constellations in the sky.

That drink is even cheaper, minus the initial cost of the press/brewer/machine. You can't brew a single bottle of beer very well, much less \"on demand\".

The Soviet union at least was in the same general ball park. They were communist with a Marxist–Leninist ideology. An extreme and specialized outgrowth of the general socialist ideology but socialism none the less. There are some conspiracy theories popular in places like the United states of America that would make you think that the Nazis were leftist or part of some communist, Jewish or homosexual conspiracy when they were very much the opposite of that and doing their best to persecute and kill everyone who actually was. The Nazis were far right and the Soviets were far left. Due to the nature of the political spectrum the two extreme points actually did have some things in common. Many of the things they had did have in common were however less outgrowth of their respective ideologies but rather a result of them both being undemocratic and not tolerating dissent as well as accumulating as much power as possibly at the top and removing possible competitors. Nazism was all about race and with some great mythology build around the concept how the Aryan race was destined to throw of the shackles of the lesser race and eventually rule. Communism had a completely different ideology that was less centered around race and more around the fact that their political ideology was destined to eventually overcome all others.

Marx described his socialism as using the unity of the working class to bring about an end to capitalism. One of Marxism's most well-known phrases is \"working people of the world, unite\". Fascism (of which National Socialism is a variation) is a doctrine which deliberately fosters enmities amongst the working class to bolster up a form of state capitalism. The Nazis were more than happy to turn sections of the working class against each other (by telling Germans that Jews, homosexuals, socialists, etc, were their enemies).

Just to add to the comments below (or, will be below once you upvote this comment - zing!): Pure mathematics, as a discipline, originates from the process of successively abstracting the ideas of concrete math. In other words, it looks for the essential structural features that make concrete math \"work,\" without the nonessential, context clues that make it concrete. Think of it like building a taxonomy of the animal kingdom by studying a bunch of animals, classifying them into categories based on their common features, then classifying those categories into categories based on *their* common features, and so on. For example, one path in mathematics might be Euclidean geometry - >  [inner product functions]( URL_5 ) - >  [norm functions]( URL_3 ) - >  [metrics or distance functions]( URL_1 ) - >  [topologies]( URL_0 ) - >  [sets]( URL_2 ) - >  [foundational axioms]( URL_4 ). At each step, \"structure is lost,\" meaning that you sacrifice some of the special properties of each for the sake of putting concepts into successively bigger groups, like squares passing to rectangles passing to quadrilaterals to polygons, or bumblebees passing to bees passing to order hymenoptera to class insecta. Anyway, the \"facts\" which hold these classifications together and connect among them are called theorems, which in order to be accepted must be able to be logically deduced from the accepted theorems \"above it\" in abstraction. For example, you can prove a statement about squares using facts about rectangles, but not vice versa. (That's what makes it deductive reasoning.) The thing is, just like we could discover a new species of bee tomorrow, we could discover some new fact about a mathematical system that hasn't yet been deduced. Or, perhaps more commonly, we could discover a proof -- pure math's standard of demonstrating logical deduction -- for something that mathematicians \"believe\" to be true based on their knowledge of the field. How would you do that? The same way you discover a new species of bee: get familiar enough with all the existing species so that you can spot the one specimen that doesn't fit the pattern, or a new pattern that no one has spotted before. In math this means immersing yourself in all the recently discovered theorems in your field, looking at how their knowledge was constructed from more general and related principles. And then go immerse yourself in those more general and related theories to understand how they work. And so on. Naturally, you typically have to start with learning a lot of general knowledge in the field, growing more specialized as you go. And then, reading a paper, you spot a theorem that you can take one step further down the line. From a logical perspective, this usually takes the form of a hypothesis you can weaken (\"All red squares are rectangles...\" Wait a minute, they don't need to be red!) or a conclusion you can strengthen (\"All squares are quadrilaterals...\" Wait a minute, they're more specifically rectangles!) And then you embark upon constructing a proof, borrowing recent results as well as general knowledge and often a stroke of insight and creativity to form the logical scaffold of the work. You write up your proof, submit it for publication, present it at conferences, teach it to your graduate students, rinse, and repeat. The last paragraph is probably an answer to what you were asking - the \"process\" of pure math research is difficult to describe because it is so often a slow, deliberative, and creatively frustrating search for the right pieces and the right way to put them together, like being in a room full of mismatched puzzle pieces and trying to put together a picture of the specific dog you had as a child. It can be years of labor for small amounts of progress, and there's no accepted procedure, just as there's no fixed procedure for designing great sculpture. But at least from my end, the few rewards pale in comparison to the thrill of the hunt. If you have the chance to pursue pure math even for a while in university, take it!

There were all kinds of diseases that people were introduced to in the new world that they didn't have in the old world. There's a fascinating book by Charles C Mann called 1493 - it's an exploration of everything that occurred after the \"discovery\" of the new world. I really suggest giving it a read", "The European settlers brought worse(better?) diseases with them and also as a result had stronger immune systems. By the time Europeans began settling the America's they had already been trading with the rest of the world for centuries and swapping diseases along with trade goods. Also Europe around that time tended to be nasty, dirty and crowded and a good breeding ground for nasty bugs. Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond(there's also a PBS special) gives an overview of all of this.", "**If** I'm remembering correctly (and I might not be, but I'm about to go to bed and I'd rather not do a bunch of fact checking research) the primary difference was that many European farmers were in heavy contact with animals they raised/domesticated, whereas Native Americans did not domesticate animals and instead relied fully on wild hunting for their meat. Because of this daily contact with multiple species of animals and their associated waste along with the fact that their residences were often in very close proximity to animal pens, they had more of a chance for diseases isolated to those animals to cross over (mutate into a form that's transmissible) to humans. There are *a lot* of deadly or harmful diseases that originate in animals often due to their own poor hygiene and general wild conditions. The disease that comes to mind foremost to me is the Bubonic Plague which was spread primarily via fleas on rodents, and reportedly killed off around a third or more of the European population. However, even today, we still have problems with animal to human cross over with diseases like Ebola, Bird Flu, and Mad Cow Disease. Thus, while Native Americans certainly had diseases that were unique to the land and killed off or harmed European settlers, the European settlers simply had more deadly/harmful diseases in their repertoire than the Native Americans did. **Edit:** And as others have mentioned (and I neglected to mention) Europeans tended to have more densely packed urban centers (which were perfect for human to human transmission) and more trade/contact between disparate populations than Native Americans.", "There's a strong theory that syphilis [did not exist in Europe until Columbus' crew personally had sex with the locals and brought it back to Europe after the first voyage]( URL_0 ). It's not 100% settled, but the theory is strongly supported by medical historical evidence. Consider that. Not just \"over time\", the *very first voyage* brought back syphilis which plagued Europe like wildfire for over 400 years before an effective treatment was discovered. It didn't annihilate Europe's population like smallpox destroyed Native American populations, but the total volume of people it infected was extremely high. Much larger populations and a much longer time. It seems inevitable though, with or without Columbus's crew's behavior. If not on the first voyage, within the next few trips someone would return with it. So the question you wanna ask is \"did Native Americans have a natural immunity built up to syphilis like Europeans had to smallpox?\" and that's really hard to say. There's no medical documentation on how syphilis worked in Native American populations. I've never heard of the observable effects of syphilis being represented in Native American lore. The observed effects are described in both European medicine and lore.", "The main reason is because the Europeans had access to large amounts of livestock. Most diseases come from animals and they had been co-living with the animals for so long that they gained immunity from a lot of diseases. The native Americans however, weren't living with any livestock (because they were nomadic  &  because there wasn't a lot of different animals capable of being \"profitable\"). Because of this, the European diseases had a greater affect (effect?) On the Natives, than the other way around.", "They totally did, they got syphilus and yellow fever amongst others.", "According to Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond, people from the old world were exposed to more types of different animals as compared to people from the new world. Interacting with animals which includes physical contact with saliva and wastes causes diseases to which people get immune after a generations of exposure. So when people from the old world met people in the new world, the former sort of brought more disease with them than vice versa.", "I think I read somewhere that Europeans illnesses were caused more often by microbes (viruses, bacteria) while New World natives had more issues with parasites. They may have specifically been talking about tropical areas in the New World though... This may also be completely incorrect...", "Native Americans populated the American continents tens of thousands of years ago, originally following herds across the Bering Strait land bridge from Asia. Living harsh nomadic hunting lifestyles, people who fell ill with diseases brought from Eurasia died quickly, and didn't have much time to spread the microbe. Eventually, these microbes were totally eradicated because they weren't being passed on quickly enough to survive in the human population. Eventually, the Native peoples of the Americas, having never interacted with these microbes for hundreds of generations, lost all immunity to them. One exception- STIs like syphillis did survive because they acted slowly and spread quickly. This is one example of diseases spread the other direction, though it never reached epidemic proportions like the diseases that came from the Old World. These microbes spread so quickly (via trade/indirect contact) that they killed entire villages before Europeans even arrived. Seeing cleared, fertilized fields, leveled land, and palisade walls, settlers (obviously incorrectly) believed the land was a gift from God, a myth justifying later logics of conquest and genocide such as Manifest Destiny. It's also worth noting that Europeans gave Native people blankets and other objects infected with Old World diseases, knowing that it would kill the community and clear the land for settlement. Source: Environmental History course at uni", "Well lots of them did. But europeans were breeding faster than people were dying in the colonies, and the long ship ride back to europe managed to prevent a lot of diseases making it back to europe. Also a lot of diseases, notably tropical ones don't survive in europe. They spread for example by insects, which in hot countries are there year round, but in europe (particularly northern europe) they die off every year. Quite a lot of the world experienced next to 0 net population growth until we started developing treatments for malaria.", "I always figured it was the home field DISadvanntage. It only took one European to introduce a disease that killed off whole populations of natives. Even if that European's entire settlement was wiped out, a disease had no way of crossing the pond, and more Europeans would arrive in a couple of months to start the cycle over again."]}

It is very important to identify what type of shock a person is in because the treatment for each is very different. The classes are: 1. Distributive: This type of shock involves dilation of your blood vessels, such that adequate blood pressure cannot be maintained. As a result, your tissues and organs don't receive enough blood. The most common cause of this type of shock is sepsis, an inflammatory state in response to a disseminated infection. Other causes include Anaphylaxis -- a severe allergic response to something like peanuts. 2. Hypovolemic: Your body does not have enough blood to circulate to your tissues. This is often seen in trauma victims who have lost a lot of blood (\"hemorrhagic shock\") 3. Cardiogenic: The heart is failing to adequately pump blood throughout the body. This may be due to conditions like heart attacks or irregular rhythms of the heart (i.e. ventricular fibrillation). 4.

That, and a central bank with extraordinarily large quantities of dollars and yuan to spend to defend the exchange rate. Germany and many other Western countries used to have a policy of fixed exchange rates. That changed when savvy people with lots of money figured out that they could \"attack\" the fixed rate. How they \"attacked\" the exchange rate is by borrowing vast quantities of German marks and buying British pounds at the fixed rate. Many investors repeated this until the German banks no longer could afford to sell pounds and buy marks to keep the exchange rate constant. At that point, the price of marks went down, the investors traded back and paid off their loans, and pocketed the difference. This process is simply not possible with China, since China does not allow currency traders to do the things they need to do to attack the exchange rate. Furthermore, the Chinese central bank has vast quantities of USD that they can use to defend the exchange rate.", "Instead of exchanging the USD they've earned into yuan (thus resulting in a surplus of USD in circulation in international currency market and short supply of yuan, in other words, devalued USD and higher value in yuan), they buy US treasury bonds, which is in USD denominations, it's not affected by the value of yuan.

There is a couple waiting for pizza that is sucking each other's face.

If you don't want to do business with \"those people,\" you are perfectly free to get the fuck OUT of the business and let somebody else have your market share. The people who are citing their religious beliefs today to refuse to do business with icky gay people are using the SAME arguments that people used to use to refuse business to blacks. It is perfectly legal to refuse service to an *individual,* even if they happen to be a member of a protected class. So you can toss out a disruptive crackhead even if he's black. And no, you can't sneak around the law by \"just happening to\" refuse service to a bunch of individuals who \"just happen to be\" members of a protected class.

It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable.\" Veal is really tender and flavourful and fatty, so if you've got taste buds like most of the rest of us, you'd probably find TASTING your BUD to be a pretty yummy experience.", "I've eaten a ton of non-traditional animals including bear and lion.

I can tell you the animals diet makes quite an impact, as does how active they are. Some are stringy, sinewy, and the texture is just unpleasant. Some are succulent and juicy but have a very irony, liver-y taste that I find unappealing. Then again, others will disagree. As far as human flesh, there are those who say it is quite tasty.

Instead they are debating the role the federal government should have (this applies to federal politicians in this context). For example Ron Paul believes that if California wants to legalize medicinal marijuana then the federal government has no right to stop California. The argument of constitutionality comes from how you interpret the constitution. There is strict and their is loose interpretation. Now politicians and the Supreme Court Justices won't say that. Instead they will say framers' intent (strict) or living document (loose). Conservative Justices will approach laws and if they rightfully fall under the powers of congress by seeing if it follows the framers' intent of the elastic clause. While liberal Justices will say that there is no way that the founders could predict everything that had changed in the world and with that we must change our views.

As far as the great respect people have for the founders, I think this comes from how they proposed a completely different governmental system that had never existed before. Before then, most governments were ruled by kings, dictators, oligarchies, theocracies, etc... The founders devised a system of self governance, in that the people are the ones in control of the government, and not a ruler chosen by birth, God, or a select few. The founders took great care in crafting the constitution, in that they intended the federal government to be very limited in scope, with only a few responsibilities, while implementing checks and balances to keep the three branches in check. As to why some politicians glorify the works of the founding fathers, I think they're just trying to appeal to the emotions of their constituency, as well as trying to say, \"Hey, I agree with these geniuses! You should vote for me!\"", "The way our (assuming you're American) Nation is set up is to idolize the founding fathers as virtuous and true. Now despite the fact that they were generally rich, white, racist, plantation owners, many Americans treat them as the 'Ideal' politician. The fact that they helped to create this Nation supposedly gives them the credibility that Politicians would like to add to their image. Don't get me wrong, I respect the Founding Fathers for what they did, but I don't believe that we should Idolize them the way we do. That doesn't mean, however, that we shouldn't uphold the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.

There is considerable diversity on both the left and the right, partly because the terms \"left\" and \"right\" are so loosely defined. As for whether the \"central figures\" of major religions are left-wing, that is debatable. In fact, I don't think you can classify many religious figures as either left or right wing at all.

The reverse happens, too: your new glasses are putting objects in focus, but they're also distorting their apparent size. If you're nearsighted and you just got a more powerful prescription, objects look slightly smaller than they used to. That messes with your depth perception, because your brain thinks everything is slightly farther away than it is.

Unfortunately a chain of completely avoidable errors caused the accident, including the ship having the absolute legal minimum of life boats which was the start of the problem. A last minute reshuffle of senior crew meant that the holder of the key to the cupboard that contained the binoculars ended up not going with the ship, and he simply forgot to hand the key back over. Numerous warnings from ships nearby (notably the Californian which was close by and had stopped surrounded by icebergs) were pushed aside by overworked radio operators who were busy sending and receiving passenger messages. The iceberg was spotted very late due to a moonless night and eerily calm waters, meaning there were no waves crashing against the bottom of the icebergs. Once it was apparent the iceberg was there, First Officer Murdoch attempted a manoeuvre to swing the front of the ship round to the left, and then push the rear of the ship outwards using the propellers in a move called a port-about. However the delay involved in switching the engines to reverse caused the ship to adopt a slow sideways drift towards the berg. Many experts believe that if Murdoch had simply turned the ship at its current speed, it would avoided the collision by some feet. Once the collision had taken place, the Captain was roused and almost immediately told by the ships designer that sinking within 2 hours was a 'mathematical certainty'. The Captain became paralysed with indecision and gave no orders other than to rouse the passengers and put their life jackets on. Prompted by other officers onboard, he ordered the lifeboats to be loaded and lowered saying \"women and children first\". However the officer in charge of one side of the ships evacuation took it as \"women and children ONLY\" and therefore dramatically reduced the amount of passengers to be saved. It is believed the Captain never officially ordered to abandon ship, or even evacuate, with many officers and staff working on their own initiative. The Californian had shut its radios down for the night, and even though both radio operators on the Titanic worked tirelessly sending distress messages (even the yet to be introduced SOS signal), the closest ship was 4 hours away. The Carpathia made full steam through the minefield of icebergs towards the ship that had given its position as 15 nautical miles from where it actually was. The Captain of this ship was later credited with saving nearly every possible survivor. The Titanic shot rockets from the deck which was seen by the Californian, however the Captain elected to ignore them. The sinking of the Titanic was a major wake up call for the authorities to start tightening procedures and regulation, as well as the media attention it received.

Generally, towels should be washed with just detergent at a relatively high temperature (60 degrees celsius+), and tumble dried to fluff up the fibres/threads to ensure maximum surface area. The drying in a machine is important, as towels which are air dried will tend to have the threads clump together which creates that rough feeling too.

Furthermore, the entire upvote-downvote system has been abused to the point of censoring minority opinions. (I call this the Downvote Disease, btw). When you get enough downvotes, your comment is hidden, and you start needing to wait in order to reply. How does this tie into your question? See what happens to people with unpopular opinions. Your example of r/rapingwomen works, but it's the same in a lot of subreddits like having a pro-gun opinion in /r/GunsAreCool or an anti-gun position in /r/progun. The minority opinion is driven out of subs into their own little subs, and removing them without them violating the site's terms of service is a lawsuit waiting to happen.", "Banning the subreddit doesn't make people stop thinking that way, it just sends them underground.

But there's more to it than that: For a lot of our genes the amount/strength of a gene's usage matters a lot—having an extra copy of a whole chromosome can be a serious problem; [an extra chromosome 21 causes Down Syndrome in humans]( URL_1 ). So how can females get away with having two copies of the X chromosome if males only have one? The answer is that in females, one of the X chromosomes is chosen at random to be inactivated and turned into a [Barr Body]( URL_0 ). In female calico cats, each patch of their skin is the descendants of an original embryo cell that ended up inactivating an X chromosome with the “be colored not white” gene on it, or a “be black not brown” gene, or whatever. In male cats, all cells only have the one X chromosome so they can't have a pattern of random inactivation. That is, unless they're an XXY male which is rare but possible.", "Females have 2 X chromosomes (1 from each parent) and males have 1 X (from mom) and 1 Y (from dad). If both X's in females were active there would be way too many proteins being made from the genes on the X chromosome so 1 of the X's needs to be inactivated. In regular female cats, both alleles of the fur color gene give the cat the same color fur so it doesn't matter which is inactivated, the fur will all be the same color. In calico cats, the alleles are different so for example: the brown spots would occur where the mom's X was inactivated and the yellow spots would occur where the dad's X was inactivated."]}

In reality countries like Nigeria are developing at quite a fast rate. The issue affecting their development is partly do do with structural issues. Political systems are pretty weak in comparison to western standards as there are lots of interests and the way in which they developed differs from the west. At the same time there are lots of internal issues to do with different ethnicities being lumped together in states (Like in Nigeria, there is a Christian south and Muslim North). So in terms of internal development, quite a lot of African states are making progress. At the same time, sending aid such as food can undercut the local produce in terms of cost. So nowadays other rising powers have alternatives such as investing in infrastructure in return for natural resources. An example is China, who will build Hydropower dams in return for resources, the benefit being that China doesn't demand a lot from them. Some African countries are more exposed to disasters such as famine due to the weather and other things like climate change and desertification. This makes developing a stable economy quite difficult. It is still important to give to these charities, as charities such as Save the Children invest in medicine for countries which lack the support for there. If an economy is to develop, it needs to make sure its workforce is sustainable and the government needs to be able to invest in growth at the same time as protecting its citizens. So sending money to them can help these countries develop faster in the long term.

Several other of my family members, myself included, have lived abroad in other developing regions. So my answer is based on those experiences.  > I just assumed they fixed one place up and moved on to the next and the place they had recently helped would just crumble and fall apart again. I think this has a lot of truth to it. In contrast to places like South America, many Africans don't make much of an effort to maintain development projects. \"Why\" this happens is a little more complicated. First off, people know that if they just don't fix anything, eventually more aid workers will come by and do it for them. What aid does come by is usually delayed by officials looking for a cut of the money, and when it actually starts it's very common for people to steal from aid programs. For example, my brother was in Cameroon auditing for a charity, and one of the biggest problems they had was when they tried to build a school or a mill, the construction materials would all get stolen. That this is allowed to happen is the result of a corrupt or nonexistant law enforcement. Then think about the kinds of people that would be likely to solve these problems - the brightest, most motivated, etc. Many of them leave their homes for good to move to America or Europe, and of course you can't blame them, because it's impossible to work in theoretical physics in Tanzania. Lastly, even when progress *is* made, it is often destroyed in war or by natural disaster. I think it's hard for most of us to imagine what that's like, because even the wars that devastated Europe in the last 100 years were, with one notable exception, political conflicts rather than targeted genocides, \"total wars,\" and that kind of thing.", "[Extremely relevant and insightful visual representation of statistical change in Africa]( URL_0 ) In short, disease, and enough political strife to prevent proper handling of these diseases.

One talked about a man who was visiting Nigeria (I can't recall if he was a tourist, or a local visiting family) and everywhere he went he kept hearing of tragedy, loss, famine, war... and he asked the people, \"why do you put up with this? why do you not do something?\" and they always replied \"it is the way it is because God made it so, you cannot change it.\" or \"its always been this way, so why bother to change?\". For instance he was told a story of a group of kids on a field trip who took off on a plane that crashed almost as soon as it was in the air - everyone died. The mothers of the kids wailed and cried - and he asked why no one had bothered to fix the plane (because mechanical failure and crappy repair jobs caused the plane to crash), they replied that \"why bother...God made the plane crash it was meant to be, no foresight on humans could have changed that - or that planes crash all the time, its normal why change it?\" But of course a little foresight would have changed the outcome of that plane crash, if the mechanics had taken their time it would have been avoided - if the cabby had fixed that back seatbelt his passengers wouldn't have died in the car crash...and so on.

Finally one I *can* answer: Your computer is finite and has a finite amount of resources. You (as a person) can only multitask and do a few things without slowing down and losing quality of what your trying to do. Don’t believe me? Try writing two different sentences on paper with each hand. Now, instead of trying to do both at the same time, write one word or one sentence after the other. You get it done a lot faster and better. This is what computers do, though they’re a lot faster, they actually do one thing at a time. It just happens to go so fast it looks like they’re doing it at the same time. Now, continuing with our human example, when you’re writing your sentences, what if you don’t know how to spell a word, or your pencil breaks? You have to stop and figure out what went wrong, and try to fix it. If you can’t figure out how to spell it, or don’t own another pencil, you’re stuck. What makes us different than computers is that when something goes wrong for us, we always have alternate solutions. For example, we can grab a pen or look up a word in a dictionary. We can see alternatives. When a computer has these kinds of errors it depends on how well the programmer made the program. If it’s a good program, it has pre-built alternatives that don’t stop it from accomplishing its task. If it’s a poorly written program, or something goes extremely wrong, the program, or the computer entirely will stop because it doesn’t know what to do.

Rebooting your router probably forced them to connect to a different network thus freeing up bandwidth for you. This can also be true of all the online devices in your house. * Your ISP sucks: Some internet service providers like to slow down the traffic of users that they catch using specific protocols (like bit torrents and encryption) which is technically illegal if they do it before killing net neutrality, but there is lots of evidence they have been doing it anyways. By restarting your router you are effectively requesting a new IP address from your ISP and that may also reset any bad things they have done to your connection. * Your router sucks: Routers are little computers. They have memory and processors and they run software just like your computer but cheaper. It is possible that simply running for a long time makes your router slow down from internal memory leaks due to bad design/firmware. * Your computer sucks: When you restart the router every service using the internet on your computer is forced to briefly accept the fact that there is no internet anymore. If one of those services was causing horrible connection issues (like some background update service), then there is a chance restarting the router will force it to end early, thus freeing your computer once the router comes back online. * You suck: There are lots of reasons that something on the internet may seem slow for a while and then seem fast later.

That most of the points hear are correct however one thing I want to point out is that your Router is like a Computer. It has a processor, storage and RAM.

They fill up with logs and the services in the background start slowing down and then it runs out of space / RAM everything slowly starts going to a crawl. What I recommend doing is getting a Good Wireless Access point / Letting the Router just be a router with DHCP. Trying to offload these services to multiple devices rather than letting your all-in-one combo router do everything.

Here's how I troubleshoot slow internet: 1) Ping my router. If the ping is double/triple digits, the problem might be there. 2) Ping Google. If the ping is triple/quadruple digits, the problem might be somewhere between my router and Google. 3) Ping the gateway. There are three \"gateways\". The 1st is your router. We've already covered that. The 2nd is the modem. The modem has 2 ip addresses. The first is the IP address between your router and the external IP address of the modem. The second is the external IP address of the modem. Ping the external IP. If the ping is high, double/triple digits, it's the modem. The 3rd gateway is outside your home network entirely and is a router belonging to the ISP. You can find its ip address by looking at your router's WAN page, if it has one. Ping it. If it's triple/quadruple digits the problem isn't yours, it's the ISP's. If none of this gives you poor ping results then the problem is farther out. Time to use another tool. 4) Tracert google. This will show you the hops and their ping times between you and Google. Hops are the routers between you and a destination on the internet that your traffic travels through. This will demonstrate where the slow down is between you and Google and generally if it's your ISP or someone else. Assuming the problem is with your router there are some things you can do. Without getting into more technical aspects, the most effective means of dealing with poor connections between the router and devices is to move the router's antenna as high as possible and centrally locate it, if possible. Change the channel. Wifi routers have about 11 channels to choose from. Defaults for routers are usually channel 6, depending on manufacturer. Moving your router off manufacturer default channels may improve things for you. Change your antennas. You can buy or make more sensitive antennas. [You can also make easily and cheaply using paper, glue  &  tinfoil a sort of directional attachment for existing antennas.]( URL_0 ) Now, if you want to get more technical, try upgrading to a 3rd party firmware like DD-Wrt. Doing so will enable additional metrics  &  features not available in stock manufacturer firmware. 3rd party firmwares often include the ability to adjust transmission power. You can literally spend weeks playing with this feature getting it just right. You can also purchase repeaters that are simple to use. Or, if you have older wifi routers sitting around, using 3rd party firmware will also enable repeater functions if not already available in stock firmware. I've done this and it works extremely well. If you're sharing your router with roommates and/or family, they might be hogging your bandwidth. 3rd party firmware literally turns a $40 router into a $10,000 router by adding features such a QoS (quality of service) allowing you to meter bandwidth based on criteria such as type of traffic and/or devices. This will allow you to give higher priority to traffic such as video streaming and/or VoIP or by allowing your roommates a maximum bandwidth so as to preserve your own or banning certain traffic such as P2P. Sometimes there's nothing you can do given the environment. Steal/concrete constructed buildings will always pose a problem for Wifi. In these environments a mix of technologies might solve certain problems. If you don't want to install networking cable, or can't, then Ethernet over Powerlines might be an option. These devices are fairly cheap turning your average power outlet into a network jack.

(The podcast is called Security Now on the TWIT network for anyone curious -- highly recommended for IT professionals and enthusiasts). Anyway; there is an issue known as \"bufferbloat\" which is caused by new routers not only at the household level, but all along the Internet network. As these new routers are designed with more local RAM, their \"short term memory\" is greater. This sounds like a good thing in theory, but in reality it isn't. It is actually better for these units to have less memory. Since there is more kept locally on each unit, they slowly become \"bloated\" with unnecessary information left over in the unit. This effect is exponential over the entire network. When you reboot your local router, it clears the memory of that unit and reduces your local bufferbloat. It does not make a tremendous difference but it is a factor. Be it a very technical one. The longer your unit has been operating continuously, the greater the effect.

Surveyors measure a project site before, during, and after they build. The first survey is to measure the existing site conditions (topography and locations for existing built stuff). After everything is measured and located, they draw up a site plan. Then architects and engineers use that site plan to design the project (building, road, etc), and they pit their design on \"blueprints\" with dimensions, etc. Once construction begins, a surveyor is back at the site to measure from the design drawings (blueprints) and locate or \"stake out\" the project on the site. Foundation walls go here, columns go here, etc. Then, as construction continues, the surveyor double checks that the work is being built correctly - correct location and height for each floor level, etc. Finally, the after-construction survey is the \"as built\" measuring exactly what's been built, so if things were in a different place than the blueprints, the actual \"as built\" location is now measured, drawn, and documented for posterity.", "They use it to measure the angle.

I have a general idea of what they do, but I have not idea how they do it!", "Surveyors use levels to find level, theodolites for relative angle and tape for distance. Laser range finders have been incorporated in the last twenty years to make total stations that combine all three capabilities. There are also laser levels that draw a standard height or line. Sort of common uses are to stake out the positions of the centreline of curve in a road. In that case they calculate the entry into the curve, then through the curve the radius is steady. For laying out a curve in a road the station can be set at the beginning of the curve then regular distances marked off along the curve with regular increases in angular divergence. So the first mark at 100m might be 2.5 degrees, 2nd mark at 200m is at 5 degrees etc. With computers there's no longer any need to setup in a simple way like that. The station can be put more or less anywhere nearby. The location of the station is only constrained by the error in the relative measurements. Elevation, transit angle and distance all have errors involved. There are standard methods of determining positions and levels that seek to correct for, minimize and check for errors. A simple one is to 'tie back in' when running a transit level. So if our survey is measuring heights of roadways near a benchmark we don't just go out with a rod and level to determine the heights through 8 setups, we also have to setup a return route to come back after our survey and tie in our height to the original benchmark to show we haven't gone too far off level during our survey. A level survey is done by setting up the tripod near a hard point that is at a known height. That is called a benchmark. The rod is set on the benchmark. The level can measure the relative height of the eyepiece, let's say the eyepiece is 2'3\" above the benchmark. Then the first shot is taken maybe 45 m away. The level has stayed in its spot and now measures its height at the eyepiece relative to its height above the spot the rod was placed as 8'4\". That's recorded. It indicates that the rodman has the rod resting on an object that is 2'3\"-8'4\" or 6'1\" below the height of the benchmark. The level moves, the rodman stays at their spot and the level sets up to take a shot at the same spot the rodman was at before. Let's say the shot shows 4'2\" as the height the eyepeice is above the spot the rod is set. That shows that the height of the eyepiece is now -6'1\"+4'2\" or 1'11\" below the height of the benchmark.

That pretty much described most horror movies.", "Horror movies and action movies are both seen in similar ways - they're not made to be an engrossing or beautiful story with complex characters and deep themes. They're just built to thrill you. Action movies usually do this in a more expensive way with explosions and car chases, and horror movies tend to be a bit more low-budget, thrilling you with jump scares and gore. Neither of those really lends itself to good storytelling, but every once in a while, there's an exception and you end up with a real classic. For horror, that would be movies like Nightmare on Elm Street or the original Saw, both of were unique and interesting stories even without the splatter, and which influenced dozens of films after.", "Because, by virtue of being included in the genre, it's kind of assumed that they are just leveraging one emotion for the entire film: Fear. There are plenty of other movies that have parts that can be plenty scary, but that also have more going on in the plot. Take, for example, *Silence of the Lambs*, or *Frailty*, or *Alien*, or *Terminator*. None of those movies are considered \"horror\" movies, but there's plenty of *killing for the sake of killing* going on, as well as constant mortal threat to the protagonists. But in films like those, there is also, generally, a question greater than \"am I going to live or die.\" Once the plot becomes any more complicated than, \"sorority girl tries to escape,\" people don't really call it a \"horror film\" anymore...", "A Youtube reviewer, Chris Stuckman, made a great 12:33 video about the problem with modern horror movies that [seems to nail it on the head.]( URL_0 )", "You've heard of Troll 2 and the Scarecrow series, yes?", "While I think that the current top comment by /u/o0joshua0o is the closet to summing things up (others have added a few solid points as well), there is still something missing. I'll try to best explain my point in a way fitting to ELI5, though this might lead to a fairly long post. The short of it is this: scaring people is easy. It isn't that the story is lacking impact or that it relies on gruesome visuals or jump-scares. If the goal of a story (a book, a movie, etc.) is to scare and it manages to do just that, then it has made a solid impact. This can be anything from the many kid-friendly campfire stories about men with hooks for hands to various urban legends or creepypastas about sleep experiments to novels about a father and husband who struggles to be a good man while dealing with his personal demons (that also happens to have a popular film adaptation that completely misses the point). Storytelling is all about the manipulation of the audience. It is like a magic act. But rather than having an audience who wants to believe an elephant can really disappear then reappear, a storyteller has an audience that wants their emotions manipulated for the purpose of entertainment. Whether it involves making them laugh, cry, or fear for their own well-being is not entirely irrelevant though it is most important that they at least feel *something* during the performance. And a good storyteller will manage to illicit at least one or more of even the most basic emotional responses all without the audience being actively aware that they are being manipulated. An audience wants to believe in the illusion. They know the story you're telling them isn't real, or at the very least isn't actually taking place at that very moment. It involves words on a page, or a man sitting at a campfire, or actors on a stage. A bad storyteller will rely heavily on familiarity to get their point across. A reused joke. A familiar plot and twist. Cliches that are meant to act as emotional shorthand, like putting a mother and child inside a burning building. The whole \"showing, not telling\" thing you often hear in writing courses or in threads like those in /r/books. The audience is, at that point, doing all the emotional work. They have to make all those connections. That music means something exciting is happening. The fat guy fell down so I need to laugh at his being fat and clumsy. Or, back to my previous example, that mother and child are in danger so I should feel concern for their safety. Shorthand is fine. And reusing old material is as well. But it's all in the execution. Anyone can reference an old Simpson's gag or quote Airplane (just look at all the reposts on reddit or anywhere else for proof of that). But not everyone can make people actually laugh at it the same way they had the first time they saw or heard it. If any laughter happens at all, it's more because they fondly recall that original moment. And this is getting to what I mean by \"scaring people is easy\". Comedy, generally speaking, is really hard. Getting a genuine laugh from people is a lot of work. Timing, delivery. To take a very basic observation and present it in such a way that gets a crowd to snort and chuckle is a quest unto itself. A bad joke or weak delivery can stink up the house real quick. Drama is the same way. A combination of a solid performance of at least passable material is required to illicit a positive response from the audience. Stilted line delivery can suck any and all emotion out of a romantic scene between lovers. Cringe-worthy dialog can lead even the most tense moment into melodrama and result in laughs from an audience. Even action requires a strong understanding of framing, editing, pacing in addition to solid choreography. An action scene is a story unto itself. The fight. The chase, be it toward a goal or away from an antagonist. It's a story within a story. And a poorly shot action sequence will not keep an audience on the edge of their seats. Weak stunt work will not get them to cheer. A poorly framed or edited punch will look fake and break the illusion. But scaring people is easy. We're all afraid of something. We all are hardwired to feel things like anxiety and stress. And to trigger such things isn't hard because it involves primitive responses to stimuli that have kept us alive generation after generation. This is why a jump scare will work on many if not most people. A video with a sudden, disturbing image and a loud audio cue is no different to the human brain than a wolf jumping out of the bushes. Horror doesn't necessarily require an emotional response so much as it does a physical and chemical response. Empathy with any of Freddy's victim isn't required to enjoy A Nightmare on Elm Street. Stilted delivery won't necessarily detract from the gore or jump scare. So long as your nervous system is lighting up and your body is flooded with things like adrenaline, the scene or story works just fine. This is why a lot of storytellers, a lot of filmmakers can cut their teeth with horror and transition to something else. All the basic ingredients are there for a good movie. Lighting. Music. Framing. It's an entry level attempt at all the emotional manipulation required in dramas and comedy. But the bar is set so low for an effective horror movie that even a weak effort can be seen as a success. Low-budgets also help convince studios to take risks on inexperienced talent. A lot of directors and actors started off in horror. Dementia 13 was one of Francis Ford Coppola's first directing jobs. Spielberg made a name for himself with Jaws. That [guy]( URL_5 ) who helped bring one of the most successful superhero franchises of all time to the big screen started off making a no-budget horror flick with his brother and big-chinned friend where a tree rapes a girl. And the dude with the two highest grossing films of [all time]( URL_3 ) started off making a sequel to a movie about killer fish, then did a movie about a killer robot, and then did a sequel about killer aliens before doing a movie about a killer robot fighting another killer robot. Not to mention the likes of actors like [Johnny Depp]( URL_1 ), [Jennifer Connelly]( URL_11 ), [Kevin Bacon]( URL_12 ), and [Crispin Glover]( URL_6 ) who all got early breaks in horror. Or even established talent that find themselves diving into (or even returning to) horror like [Gary Oldman]( URL_7 ), [Frank Langella]( URL_10 ), [Willem Dafoe]( URL_8 ), and [Sir Ian McKellen]( URL_2 ). Scaring people is easy. And even the most [mundane]( URL_4 ), [uneventful] ( URL_0 ), [low-reaching]( URL_9 ) horror films can become runaway successes. It isn't the talent involved. It isn't the story failing to make an impact. It's that anyone with a camera and a few friends can make it happen and garner some attention. Of course, like all other genres it takes a lot of work and effort and talent to master the horror genre. So few names have managed to do it compared to others. When everyone can be scared, when we all share so many of the same fears, it takes a real creative mind to present something so daringly unsettling that it not only perseveres for years to come but also illicit the same emotional response. King, Barker, Lovecraft, Poe, Romero, Craven, Hooper, Carpenter, and so many others have mastered the genre. Some stick around and love to play in the same sandbox time and again. Others move on to the next challenge, maybe returning now and then when the mood strikes them. It isn't that horror isn't respected. It's that scaring people isn't hard. Keeping people afraid is. And so few manage to do it just right.", "There's a bit of a problem with the horror genre, and this problem is the writing. How many horror movies do you know that are genuinely scary purely because of the writing? There are a few, but not many. All the other movies depend on gruesome visuals, \"scary\" music and maybe a jumpscare here and there to keep you on the edge of your seat, but these are all easily picked apart gimmicks. I think there's a movie called mama or mother or something which I saw a while ago with friends of mine, despite being drunk and an easily frightened baby it just didn't do anything for me. The premise was stupid at best in my opinion, the scares were easily predictable, the music was cliché. It was a decent movie by all means but it was just so standard and come on: Do we trust hollywood to make a movie that is unconventional and doesn't follow a predetermined checklist? These are the movies that make the best horror but they are a risk and Hollywood doesn't take risks.", "Honestly, I think it's because fear is a deeply personal, uncomfortable feeling for a lot of people. When a film attempts to frighten you and it fails, it's easy to feel insulted. When a film attempts to frighten people and succeeds, they don't always enjoy it. People often compare sense of fear to sense of humor, inasmuch as there's a certain amount of compulsion to it. You don't choose to laugh and you don't choose to be afraid. You just respond to the stimulus you're taking in, and the reaction is involuntary. Beyond that, even among horror fans, there's a lot of variance. Some people like torture porn, some people are all about jump scares, some people just want to see badass monsters, and then you've got guys like me who prefer to be scared long after the movie is over, when the plot or characters linger in the back of your mind.", "I thought the premise of The Purge was incredibly wasted. It's interesting, brings out the worst in people, and just bleeds suspense. But then they go and lock the family in the house and then it's a simple home invasion horror story. If they had done something such as a family going camping far away and losing track of time before the Purge, realize the date, and then have them flee terrible people while trying to get back home to safety - that would have been something worth watching.", "For an example, look at the horror movie \"You're Next\". Mild spoilers will follow, but nothing significant. So, this family is getting attacked while they're eating dinner, from outside the house, and their plan is to let their daughter sprint barefoot out of the house in hopes of like... I dunno, running and getting help or something? And no character in that movie stops and says \"Hey, this is fucking stupid. Seriously.\" She sprints out the door and garrotes herself on a wire in the door frame, and everyone is like \"Oh man, who would've thought her running unarmed into the area where our assailants are, with no foot protection in the woods would've ended tragically!?\" Some can absolutely argue that You're Next is a healthy dose of tongue in cheek, but like Shawn of the Dead, it's poking fun at it's brethren. It's hard for critics and stuff to accept horror movies as legitimate story telling devices when you have movies like The Strangers, wherein the bad guys do things that the protagonists never actually notice that immediately reminds your brain that you're watching a movie. Horror films are typically pretty cheap to produce, and ever since the Blair Witch Project, they've gotten cheaper, to the point where we can all enjoy \"Skype, the horror movie\" this weekend.. BWP made absolute bank because it was full of no names. Paranormal activity, Saw, all of them lack pretty significant names, in order to save more on money. And finally, horror movies are polarizing. Myself and my wife love to watch them, but none of my friends do. They hate horror movies, they hate how the movies make them feel, even when the movie is blatantly not scary (this is subjective, but for me it's movies such as the aforementioned You're Next and The Strangers). Why spend a lot of money and effort when you have giant swathes of people who write it off instantly because they don't like horror?", "Because the bulk of horror has more in common with pornography than with regular cinema. What I mean is, there is a tendency in the genre to set up a scenario *just* enough to get the horror going and then it coasts on cheap scares and senseless gore until the end. It relies on a loose plot whose only purpose is to get the audience some standard-issue thrills. That's not to say that there aren't great horror films, because by god there really are some amazing ones, but that the pornographic aspect of horror tends to not only taint the perception of the genre, but also bleed into the rest of the genre itself. People become so accustomed with *that* being horror that they feel ripped off when they go to the theater and that's not what they see. Think the \"that wasn't even scary\" crowd. As a result you either get amazing movies that fall under the radar or movies that, because they are so \"good\" are not considered horror. As an example of this I would use \"Black Swan\". One could make a solid argument for it being a horror movie in the purest sense. But few consider it as such. Because it's \"good\", and horror is \"bad\". And because horror has jump scares and dim lighting. So my answer I guess is that the genre is a vicious cycle turned on itself.", "It can be argued that Horror is a genre which doesn't need to be respected in order to be successful, so horror movies don't always go for that. They are usually cheap to make and have a niche audience that they don't have to really try new things with to entertain. Lack of originality and creativity also seem to be an issue. Creativity generally arises in new methods of being gory (which seems to be heavily looked down upon) and many horror films carry a negative mark of exploitation. Horror movies which are considered respected either try new things and play with a formula (like Cabin in the Woods or Scream) or are layered with other genre's (like how Silence of the Lambs is a \"thriller\" despite following the slasher film formula very closely). There's also just a general public and critical misunderstanding and prejudice which I actually think is a big issue. When Psycho and Peeping Tom were first released they were ostracized for exploiting violence, but later reviews and rewatching over the years people start saying that they are masterpieces of film making. Film critics often struggle to tell the difference between exploitation and art I guess? Turning up big money ties back to my point of it being niche. Horror is successful because its cheap, big budget includes big risks which studios don't generally want to go for. A lot of fans would love a big budget movie, especially if its a crossover work, like an Avengers for Horror movies.", "I'd say it has something to do with the fact that it's the hardest genre to do well (and that's not hyperbole, I assert that horror is the *most* difficult genre). It's incredibly difficult to make a scary film, and the nuances that make it possible can also be prohibitive towards other aspects of good film making. It's hard to tell a story, and maintain good suspenseful pacing, and foster a tone that speaks to the fears of your audience all at the same time. As a result: a lot of B-movies are horrors/ thrillers, which may have degraded respect for the genre over the years. It's too bad really, B-movies are one of my favorite categories of film, and deserver more respect in my opinion. More people should give them the appreciation they deserve (I am of course talking about *good* B-movies: the Room, anything directed by Peter Jackson, Shrooms, etc).", "Because horror cliches with rare exceptions are just plain stupid. Like why does the bad stuff always happen in the dark?... are you telling me angry ghosts can't haunt during the day? There's that movie Fear Dot Com that was dark EVERYWHERE, even inside the police station... so many other cliches as well, like the old open up the mirror to take something out of the medicine cabinet, close it to find a murderer standing behind you in the reflection... There's only a few movies that come to mind as horror done well. Alien, The Shining, The Blair Witch Project, The Ring... probably a couple more I can't think of at the moment.", "There was a time when high caliber actors did films like that. Jack Nicholson was 22 years past his first real movie credit when he told Wendy he wouldn't hurt her if she'd just give him the bat. Those exceptions aside, as someone pointed out, horror films generally depend on either fear or women in skimpy clothing who make stupid decisions, often while babysitting someone else's kids in someone else's home. That sort of discourages actors with pride from taking those roles.", "I've learned to read between the lines of rating scores. Sites like Rotten Tomatoes are never going to give a horror film much above a 7. So realistically, anything over 5 might be worth looking into. With regular movies it's more like anything above a 7 might be worth seeing.", "Silence of the Lambs was respected. It just takes a film with good writing, and most horror films don't put much effort into the plot/dialogue.", "Recent exception... The Conjuring. Really slick cinematography, real scares and an insane climax. Also, has anyone checked out Housebound?", "Show me a horror movie with a deep subplot beyond \"run away and die a bunch\".", "Because most of the horror films are absurdly overdone cliches.", "It's easy to make a horror film but difficult to make a good one. Many horrors tend to stick very tight to their foundations and often stick to their respective audiences, in recent years I've found myself looking for foreign horrors such as french extremism to get a good one. But i'd say the main reason is too few horrors try to break conventions or they purposefully do it and make sure you know about it. A cabin in the woods is a good horror for me as it explains this very by just being as it shows everything that is good and bad about horror. Quite often if i watch one with the misses it's all about the one with the brutal kills and the messed up stuff, i try to watch a proper horror and she finds it boring which leads on to the next point. Many film critics just don't know how to review it, horror critics will do it as a horror whilst film critics try to place it as an action or comedy, failing that they will attempt to extract deeper meaning from a horror when one may just not exist; Sometimes all a good horror needs is a psycho with an axe, no we do not care about why, no we do not want a trilogy that explains their motivations, we just want to see some nudity and teens getting killed. So in summary I'd place it to convention overtaking the story, a deeper story means drifting from the horror elements too much which the audience may find boring. therefore story often gets put aside for the horror elements which means classical reviewers may struggle to fit the film to their method of marking; it's like giving an expert on fine wines a bottle of exclusive locally produced ale and expecting a review, yes it's alcohol but not quite a fine Bordeaux", "The same traits of horror movies that are used in EVERYTHING (ex. jump scares is the main one, excess blood, running from stuff, etc.) have been used time and time again for decades. It's no wonder that these movies have burnt out so quickly; so few of them are actually memorable or good anymore, and a lot of them end up being super cheesy and weird (I remember when I watched Cabin in the Woods, it was good to start but then by the end I was like . . . what?). I'm a fan of psychological thrillers myself. These tend to be a lot more horrifying than actual \"horror\" movies, as they play with your thoughts and really make you think about stuff. Some of my favorite darker psychological films are those of Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, Pi). I also really liked the Cube films (kinda obscure trilogy, but pretty good films). Last House on the Left is also a good thriller. Everything else these days, in the pure sense of \"horror\", without bringing thriller into it, tends to just be \"social media is evil!\" and \"oh no there's a murderer in town!\" Kinda depressing to see that horror movies haven't changed much since the 20th century.", "It's true that there haven't been many good high budget horror movies recently, but there are LOTS of low budget/indie or foreign productions that are actually very clever, with great storytelling, acting and effects. Martyrs is an excellent example of a film that can be extremely brutal, terrifying and gruesome, but it's also incredibly smart in its social commentary. Lake Mungo is another unknown gem that explores and analyzes the concept of grief through a pretty scary ghost story. A Tale of Two Sisters is another amazing \"horror\" movie with similar themes... And I could go on. As for why the horror genre in general isn't more respected, I'd say it's pretty obvious. Most people who watch horror movies just want to be scared or grossed out. They want to see stupid people get their well deserved gruesome deaths, they want to see scary ghosts jump at them, get their adrenaline rush and leave. They don't want to feel bad, to actually *think* about death, grief, and all those other heavy themes that a clever horror movie would include. It's just much easier to produce and sell a movie that's basically 100% blood/jumpscares.", "Horror as a genre is respected. Hitchcock is brilliant, as well as most other classic film makers. However, the horror genre today is less about plot and more about blood and guts or just how crazy the bad guy is because he's probably killing for no reason. It's not just the horror genre. Comedy has gone so far downhill, it's all dick and fart jokes followed by nutshots. Don't believe me? What was the last action film you so that wasn't totally ridiculous? Drama just gets respect for not seeming so juvenile and musicals get respect for being able to tell a story with song. What's really gripping about horror and comedy is that it hits us on such a basic level. The beauty in the cinematic art form though is to still touch upon those essential emotions while still making us feel more. Taking us on a journey. Too many movies just cash in on the lowest form of entertainment they can without trying for anything greater, and that's sad.", "Why don't studios ever invest big money into horror films? --- Because, in large part, horror films these days tend to be made on gore and shock value, not on writing. Very rarely does a horror film both play to your visceral fears AND feature good writing. When it does, it's a unicorn. (Paranormal Activity had me sleeping with the lights on for months but was SO BRILLIANT.) Why don't high caliber actors/directors/writers get involved in horror films that often? -- Because most horror films in the industry suck, and horror tends to equal pulp, which isn't always that good, though I fondly do love pulp stuff.", "different movies genres are trying to evoke different emotions(reactions from viewers) so horror movies try to make you scared action movies display adrenaline junkies pornographic movies want to evoke your lust Big movies use a mix of different genres. so you might need to combine a love scene with an action scene and there will probably be a lot of drama too. the more complex the emotions displayed in movies the more difficult they are to make and the more acclaimed they are. hope that makes sense for you.", "It's the genre that's possibly saturated with cliches that we've seen in horror movies.

{"example_id": 193, "context": "", "question": "Why does using data on phones cost so much money?", "answer": ["One reason is because they can - they control your ability to connect to the internet from almost wherever you want, so they can charge more for it than you would pay for home internet. Another reason is that it costs them a fair bit of money to build and maintain that network, so the cost gets passed on to you, the customer.", "It all boils down to supply and demand. If you're out of the house and need to connect to the internet you have two options: Connect to a random WiFi network (which takes time and there might not be one available) or use mobile data. Therefore the added value of the mobile data is efficiency. People will be able to pay more for there internet access as it is convenient and can be used anywhere. (High demand and low supply due to lack of WiFi networks)", "Two reasons: (1). It's what the market will bear. (2). There's actually a physical limit to the amount of data which can be transmitted at any given time, which creates a finite supply over the course of a week or month, which is apportioned (albeit less than efficiently) via data plans and the expense of them. So, this gets a bit technical, so if you're actually interested let me know and I'll go more into detail (including a suit by a company trying to use an unused part of of the electromagnetic spectrum against GPS manufacturers over the issues I'm going to try to explain). So, all phone data relies on transmission using electromagnetic waves. The simplest analogy would be to FM radio. Notice how the stations are separated on your dial (if you have a station on 99.5 you would put another at 99.7 or 99.8 not at 99.6)? If you ever tune to the frequency between you might notice that you hear part of the nearby station, but it's weak and often garbled. This is because of what's called \"out of band emissions.\" Basically, because electromagnetic waves are waves, the actual station (99.5 in our example) is the crest. But it flows out in both directions, with part of the wave going into 99.4 and part in 99.6. 99.5 would be the station's \"band\", and the spill-over would be OBE. So what would happen if you put another station at 99.6? Well it wouldn't be a good signal, it would be interfered with by the station at 99.5. There are ways to compensate for this (a lot of research is going into limiting out of hand emissions and making phones more sensitive to picking up data from a smaller band), but fundamentally that means that within a given part of the \"spectrum\" (basically all of the wavelengths for electromagnetic waves) there are a maximum number of stations which can effectively be used. So if I sold you the rights to use all of the spectrum between 99.0 and 100.1, how many stations could you effectively use? About 5. So now you have to decide how to apportion time on those stations for various broadcasts. Those broadcasts are the data your customers are using, and given that you have a finite amount to sell, you're going to sell it for a lot.", "Because that is how much you will pay. The price of something often has little to do with the cost.", "Just to confirm, you're asking about US? Data doesn't cost much at all in most countries afaik.", "In the US, the primary cause is scarcity, and the one limiting factor for wireless carriers is access to the wireless spectrum. (Source: I've deployed GSM networks) In much the same way your ISP provides you with a limited amount of bandwidth, the throughput of a wireless connection is also limited, and the total area being served by a cellular broadcast tower needs to be divided up between all the people who wish to use it. Compared to voice calls and many other wireless users, cellular data is bandwidth-intensive, and require large portions of spectrum to transmit data at high speeds. The highest-capacity towers are serving up at most a few hundred MB of total capacity. For many of us, this capacity isn't much greater than our home WIFI. When cellular communication hit the market, the FCC had already reserved the rights to the best parts of the wireless spectrum for radio, television, government, industrial, or medical use (which could be best utilized by cheap, reliable hardware). So, wireless companies bid on whatever portions of the spectrum they can get their hands on (which also drives up the prices). Some of these portions of the spectrum required new or specialized (and more expensive equipment) to operate. For example, in 2008, the rights to use the 700mhz spectrum was auctioned for about $12B US. I believe the networks who were able to secure the largest portions of usage rights in this deal, at best, doubled their capacity in some areas. Also, there is effectively an upper-limit to the portion of the spectrum that can be used for mobile communication devices. In order to maximize battery life, cell phones need to transmit at very low power. And, at lower wattages, lower-frequency signals will have an advantage, attenuating at a much slower rate, and traveling much farther. The only real option available now to combat the high cost of the wireless spectrum is to deploy smaller cell towers more densely, which each cover a much smaller area. If the area was reduced significantly, new portions of the spectrum would be available at higher frequencies, and low-power broadcast would still be feasible, since the total broadcast distance is reduced. Prices are not likely to come down any time soon. However, advances in battery technology or the mass deployment of very small (pico) cell towers could one day dramatically reduce costs. TLDR; Not all portions of the wireless spectrum are “created” equally, and demand is very high for the best parts of it. This is driving up prices, and activities which utilize it the heaviest (such as wireless data), are forced to pay a premium for it."]}
{"example_id": 194, "context": "", "question": "When we say that solar power is not (yet) efficient, what exactly do we mean?", "answer": ["Typically when using the word \"efficiency\" in a comparative fashion for energy production the measurement refers to the source-energy relative to the converted usable energy. E.G. if gasoline has X amount of energy in it, the combustion engine can only create about X*.3 of that to its usable energy (movement, in this case). A solar panel converts about 20ish percent of the suns energy. If we compare that to other forms of _electricity_ production (the most reasonable analogue for your not-well-defined statement) then we'd be saying that \"compared to the efficiency of capture of energy from coal and conversion to electricity, solar panels are significantly less efficient\". The REASON we might emphasize this statement however is that increasing efficiency of the panel in this dimension is correlated with requiring less physical space, likely high return on investment of actual purchase of the panels and so on. Its perceived that improved efficiency - amongst other things - is the path towards more economic viability for widespread solar.", "At least colloquially, speaking as someone who studies the economics of climate change, efficiency in this context is usually referring to cost-efficiency. That is, how much money does it cost to make, install, and maintain enough solar panels to create [X] watts of power capacity. Right now, solar is still being developed, and it cannot yet compete economically with more established conventional electricity generation, mostly coal and natural gas, with nontrivial amounts coming from hydroelectricity and nuclear. (Wind and biomass are pretty small compared with the other four I listed, but are most of the remainder.) Consumers demand electricity, and rational economic agents would seek to get it at the lowest possible price, so in the absence of regulatory action, they would get their electricity from coal and natural gas, which are cheaper per watt-hour (i.e. energy/Joules). However, coal and natural gas both have pollution externalities - the pollution produced by burning coal is really nasty (not just carbon pollution, which contributes to climate change, but also sulfur, NOx, and heavy metal contaminates, which are ugly stuff), and consumers aren't paying for the harm caused by this pollution. Therefore, we want to steer policy in the direction toward cleaner fuels, of which solar is a part. The problem is just what your title asks - solar isn't yet cost-effective enough to compete with natural gas and coal (though it probably will be in five years). This is because we are still making great advancements in developing solar technology (it's a relatively new and highly technical field). So, in order to stimulate investment into the solar industry, we have to subsidize it somehow, generally either through adoption credits (giving tax rebates to people who install solar panels), feed-in tariffs (mandating that your utility company compensates the supplier for the electricity that household/business generates), or carbon taxes (not exactly a subsidy, but a tax on coal acts in a similar manner to a subsidy on coal). The hope is that with a temporary subsidy, we can get enough investment in the industry to make solar cheaper than natural gas and coal, after which point we permanently move into a clean-energy world. If there is enough demand for solar (because of government subsidies), this encourages innovation into the solar industry, which should lower the cost of adoption (either by making the photovoltaic cells themselves more efficient, cheaper to produce, lowering installation costs, economies of scale, etc.) to the point where solar can compete as a cost effective alternative to conventional electricity generation. But we're not quite to the point where solar can directly compete on the basis of costs alone. (Storage capacity is a big part of this.) I'd be glad to elaborate further on any part of this.", "At the most basic level, it's possible to measure the efficiency with which a solar panel takes the energy from the sunlight hitting it and turns it into electricity. There's only so much sunlight striking a particular solar panel, and there's only so much space on a roof or wherever to put a solar panel, so you want the panel to be as efficient as possible. If a solar panel only converts 1% of the energy hitting it into useful electricity, then even if I spent tens of thousands of dollars to cover 100% of my roof with them, I won't get enough electricity to run my air conditioner, even on a bright sunny day. So that's not a very appealing option to me. But if your solar panels are 15% efficient, then I can spend significantly less money only covering half of my roof with panels, and still get way more electricity than my entire roof would've made with 1% efficient panels. Especially because efficiency gains tend to outpace the cost increases. A 15% efficient panel probably isn't going to cost 15x what a 1% efficient panel would cost, despite providing much better performance.", "When people talk about the [efficiency]( URL_0 ) of solar panels, they're referring to the amount of electricity it creates compared to the amount of solar energy it recieves from the sun. Most solar panels only convert 15-20% of the sunlight they're exposed to into electricity, so they are 15-20% efficient. The theoretical maximum efficiency (a \"perfect\" solar cell) is thought to be around 86%."]}

You still get a punishment for it, but if you and your wife had a big fight and it escalated to a physical one that ended *without injury* and that was the only time it's happened then you won't get in huge trouble but you still lose more than five hundred USD, 15 days jail time, or 120 days community service. You will get in bigger trouble if it happens again.", "The prior regulation was (subjectively) harsh in comparison to even regulations in the US. Take NY Penal Law 240.26 which essentially proscribes the same type of conduct and calls it \"Harassment.\" If you don't injure another party but you make contact, it can be punishable by up to 15 days and a $250 fine. The new Russian statute has the same sentence except a higher fine and NY is just pass a whole mess of new family regulations punishing repeat domestic violence offenders, so it isn't that the State is lax. The outrage is just a media misunderstanding and geared at making the public hate Russia.", "Domestic violence was reclassified based on the nature of the incident. If it was physical and a party was injured you will head to court on relevant assault criteria. If you called her a drunken whore (im assuming youre an adult eli5) then you will not be criminally considered. The previous law allowed too much freedom to judges. The current law is less abstract and enforces minimum CRIMINAL charges."]}
{"example_id": 196, "context": "", "question": "How did a small country like Japan occupy a vast country like China, while still projecting power elsewhere, during the buildup to WW2?", "answer": ["1: They didn't occupy all of China, only parts of the coastline. 2: China was in the middle of a Civil War between the communists and the nationalists, they weren't prepared for an invasion. The two factions did band together to repel the Japanese, but it was an uneasy alliance, and by 1938 it was breaking down. 3: China wasn't exactly the most technologically advanced nation at the time of the Second Sino-Japanese war. For example, they still used biplanes while the Japanese Air Force had actual fighters. 4: Not only were the Chinese technologically inferior, they also had less of everything except manpower. Take a look at the chart [here]( URL_0 ). In 1939 Japan had almost 5 times the aircraft, 4 times the tanks, and 1.5 times field artillery. By 1941, the ratios got even worse. 5: Japanese soldiers were fanatics during battle. Officers often stressed the importance of no retreat, of death over dishonor. This led to Japanese troops achieving victories from the brink of defeat. 6: Japan had the resources to control major cities, but lacked the manpower to lock down the vast countryside, where the Chinese would often launch guerrilla strikes. And by 1941, when the USA joined the war, Japan had to reallocate resources to another front.", "From around 1600 to the mid-1800s, during the Edo period, Japan was a [closed]( URL_0 ), isolationist society. Foreigners were not welcome, and Japanese were not allowed to travel. This ended in 1853 when an American navy fleet led by Commodore Perry [sailed in]( URL_4 ) and said \"Hi, you're going to be trading with us now.... or else.\" The Japanese leadership was still stuck with 200-year-old technology -- literally bows and arrows and swords -- and had nothing to fight back against modern steam warships. So they had no choice but to agree to Perry's demands. Over the next few years, other world powers including Russia also used their navy to push Japan around. Japan was humiliated, and decided to do something about it. They engaged in a crash program of modernization. During the [Meiji]( URL_3 ) era, they hired westerners to teach science and engineering, built railroads, factories, modern schools and hospitals, and most importantly, conscripted a powerful modern army and navy. Within 30 years, Japan had become a modern industrial nation, powerful enough to defend itself against western powers. But that meant it was also powerful enough to go up against its neighbors. As a small island nation, Japan had limited food and mineral resources, and was worried about attack from foreign powers. And hey, if you've got a modern army and navy, there's a huge temptation to use it. To keep its new modern society running, Japan decided to [attack Korea]( URL_1 ), which was very weak militarily, and under the control of China, which had a much less modern military and was dealing with a major revolt on the other side of China at the time. Japan won handily, taking over Korea. Several more conflicts followed against [Russia]( URL_2 ) and China, centered around Japan being worried that they might try to take Korea away, and Russia and China being worried that Japan might not stop with Korea. Japan won all of them, eventually leaving them with control of all of Manchuria (what's now northern China). Not just the coastline, as /u/Dueling7 describes, but up to 700 miles inland to the modern border of Mongolia and Russia. This gave Japan control over the resources of a huge region, and the (unwilling) labor of about 45 million people. This, plus their technological superiority, made them the most powerful empire in the region. So the main answer to the question is that Japan engaged in a crash modernization program after being bullied by Western powers, but it's worth mentioning that things in China were not going nearly as well at the time. The ruling Qing dynasty were ethnic Manchurians, and not popular among the majority Han Chinese. Several popular uprisings against the emperor occurred during this time. In addition, Western powers were working hard to get the entire country hooked on opium so they could profit off it, and several failed revolts against Western trade occurred as a result. China tried to carry out the same modernization program the Japanese were pursuing, but civil unrest and foreign meddling made it impossible.", "The population difference was not as large as you would guess. China had a population of ~517 million and Japan had 73 million in what is Japan today. Add to that 30 million in Korea and Taiwan that Japan had controlled since. 1910 , 1895 So the population difference is only 5:1. China was not a united country but split and there had been a civil war since 1927 between the communist and the Republic of China- Republic of China had formally control on all parts of china expect the communist controlled since 1928 but the former warlords had huge influence and control of their former areas. The Republic of China and communist had a temporary and of the civil war to unite against Japan in 1936 So a country ravaged by civile war was against a united and undamaged country. It is no surprise that better equipped and trained Japanese troops had success in the war. Japan did not occupied all of China Look at the maps [here](  URL_0 ). A estimation is that is they only occupy 1/3. Manchuria was already a Japanese puppet state since 1905. Xinjiang and Tibet that is today controlled by China is not included in the estimation. As they are separated on the maps when they was semindependent/independent at the time."]}

They made the Irish grow wheat to export and forced them to grow potatoes to eat. When the potato failed, there was nothing left, and the British were not about to give up their profits for humanitarian concerns, especially not for Catholics. If there had been a revolt, the British would have slaughtered thousands with their superior weaponry and organization. They'd done it many times before. If you ever wonder why groups like the IRA and Sinn Fein exist, centuries of behavior like this is it. Not saying terrorism is justified, but being angry at the British over this history absolutely is.", "Ireland had existed in an on again off again state of rebellion for the previous three centuries. The UK usually had something akin to martial law in place, so rebellion was more difficult than it might seem. After that is was just money and power. During a previous famine, ports were closed to prevent food exports. Merchants protested because they had to sell their food at low local prices, which cost them dearly. This time around, the merchants prevailed and were allowed to export their cash crops, and the locals had neither the money nor the power to stop them.", "You would be surprised at how common this is; same happened in both Russia and China under communism. Remember that the people with guns and/or power are the ones who get fed, and if a people are not very strong compared to their government, people generally see their odds of survival better if they just try to wait it out. More likely to survive a famine than a bullet in the head.", "The fact that they were literally starving probably had something to do with it. And there was significant resistance in Ireland to the British export policy, including armed rebellion. None of it was successful, obviously.", "Revolutions almost never occur when things are bad and getting worse.

{"example_id": 198, "context": "", "question": "Why are user names not case sensitive?", "answer": ["In situations where the username is used as a displayed name, case sensitive usernames would enable someone to attempt to impersonate someone else just by registering a new account with a different permutation of capital/lowercase letters. The same applies for web domains. For emails, case sensitive addresses would result in a lot of undelivered emails from someone forgetting which letters were capitalized or not. Etc. Also worth noting that some companies, like Wells Fargo, do not use case sensitive passwords as an added convenience to the user. For passwords, passwords are supposed to be arbitrary, are not stored in plain text or ever displayed, and allowing case sensitive passwords enables a massively wider range of possible passwords to discourage guessing.", "I'm probably going to get corrected on this, but there's nothing universal to either. You can have a password system that isn't case sensitive and you can have a username/email system that is.

This drone strike violates that principle, even in the most narrow readings of the law.", "It comes down to questions of whether they are, or will be, used ethically. Military drones are often used in counter-insurgency/counter-terror operations, where the enemy is out of uniform and surrounded by non-combatants. People claim that drones have injured or killed civilians during these missions. Collateral damage is always bad press, not to mention that these are essentially assassination missions. Domestic use of drones for surveillance and pursuit is controversial as well, which seems to be mostly based on a lack of trust in police using them ethically. There is also the possibility of using them to expose and persecute people for \"morality\" crimes, such as homosexuality or failure to uphold religious mandates. tldr; People are pissed about drones because they don't trust the people using them.", "A few other things that haven't been mentioned: 1. Surveillance. Unweaponized drones can engage in espionage, and that's difficult territory to work out (especially in the framework of Geneva). 2. Some guy can drop his kids off at school, drive to work, press a button that kills a person on the other side of the world, and come home for dinner. It skews the psychological balance of warfare to an arguably unfair degree. 3. [Double tapping]( URL_0 ) and other tactics that are at best legally and ethically questionable.", "Because in general international law and human custom goes like this 1) Killing people you're at war with is okay 2) killing people you're not at war with is not okay 3) sending your army into someone else's country is an act of war 4) using a neutral third party as a battlefield in a war your fighting with somebody else is very much not okay So, are we at war or not, and who with? We declared war on Afghanistan and Iraq, so nobody much minds if we try and kill people there. We also say we're in a \"war on terror.\" What the fuck that means, nobody really knows. You can't be at war with an idea. You can be at war with a defined group of people, and Congress also passed a bill after September 11th saying that the president could take any steps necessary to kill or capture the people behind the September 11th attack, or in other words, Al Qaeda. We have, for the most part. Is Congress' declaration still good to let us go around killing whoever the fuck we want as long as somebody, somewhere, is still using the name \"Al Qaeda\"? Nobody knows. If you take the view that it is not --- that is, the view that has held for pretty much all of civilization, which is that just going around and killing anyone who might pose a threat to you someday is fucked up and should be illegal --- then drone attacks are a problem. As a general rule, crossing other country's borders with your military and killing people is regarded as an act of war. The reason we're getting away with it is that we have this vague \"war on terror\" fig leaf and also we're the richest country in the world and have the biggest military, so no matter how much other countries don't like it, there's really very little they can do to stop it. 2, terrorists aren't the only casualties of drone attacks. Civilians are often killed. Sure, you might argue that they're often somehow connected to the terrorist --- their wives and children and cousins, people sheltering them. Sometimes though, it's just someone who was in the wrong place at the wrong time, or the intelligence was wrong in the first place. If we're at war, then this is maybe legal. If we're not, this is murder.", "The issue isn't necessarily drones themselves, but extra-judicial killings without oversight or even disclosing the legal framework behind the killings.
