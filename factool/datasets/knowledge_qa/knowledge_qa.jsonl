{"prompt": "Why do veins appear blue?", "response": "Veins appear blue because of the way light passes through human skin.

The oxygen-poor blood then returns to the heart through the veins.\n\nWhen light enters the skin, it penetrates into the layers of tissue and is absorbed or scattered by the various structures within. Because blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light, it is scattered more easily and penetrates deeper into the tissue. As a result, more blue light is absorbed than red light, making the veins appear blue.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that veins are not actually blue, but rather a dark shade of red or purple.
